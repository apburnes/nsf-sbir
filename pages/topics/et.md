Environmental Technologies cover a range of innovations that bring the promise of sustainability, high commercial impact and/or societal and environmental benefits. The topic covers a wide range of technology areas of current and emerging commercial significance pertaining to the technologies and materials that improve environmental and or environmental health outcomes. Sensing, data, and advanced analytics technologies relevant to these fields are also appropriate. If the proposed technology or approach addresses a problem without a current solution or one which is underdeveloped, this should be highlighted.

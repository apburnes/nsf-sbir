    Research Phase II project is to commercialize Pyrochem Catalyst Company's (PCC)
    catalyst materials.   These catalyst materials are unique in that the catalytically
    active metal is atomically dispersed in a rigid crystalline matrix.  This imparts
    unparalleled thermal stability, even at temperatures in excess of 1000Â°C.  Conventional
    catalysts typically require much higher precious metal loadings (as much as 20
    times) to achieve the same activity as the materials developed in this project
    and at high temperatures those active metals can agglomerate into large clusters
    reducing their performance and the lifetime of the catalyst.  The series of catalysts
    developed in this project are designed in a way that all precious metal is optimally
    utilized and protected.  This includes resistance from sulfur poisoning and the
    accumulation of carbon when operating under severe conditions.  This makes these
    materials ideal for high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming
    for hydrogen generation, autothermal reforming for syngas production, syngas generation
    in oxygen transport membranes (OTM), and exhaust oxidation in automotive catalytic
    convertors.     \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II STTR program are to build
    on the success of the Phase I objectives that developed a low cost and continuous
    catalyst manufacturing method for producing the pyrochlore powders that are the
    basis for the proposed catalyst product.  The method may be equally effective
    for producing other types of mixed metal oxides like perovskites and fluorites.
    In Phase II, PCC will construct and test a scaled-up production platform, following
    the design elements of the proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  The new
    unit will be designed to manufacture proprietary pyrochlore powders at a rate
    with a hundred-fold increase over production rates of the Phase I unit.  The Phase
    II technical efforts also examine a range of catalyst synthesis parameters like
    oxidant gas concentration/composition, temperature distribution in the production
    unit, precursor residence times, synthesis solution chemistry, and optimizing
    heat and mass transport.  Through a subaward, powders produced from the process
    will be characterized and tested for activity by the National Energy Technology
    Labs, Morgantown, WV.  The overall goal of this project is the development of
    a high throughput / high yield manufacturing process that produces high performance
    catalysts for commercial sale."

    enable video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes
    (2PMs) by developing novel deformable membrane mirror (DMM) technology for fast,
    precise focus control. As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), 2PMs
    achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam
    to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low-energy infrared
    photons to stimulate emission in the visible spectrum. Because of the increased
    resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with
    other LSM methods, 2PMs have become widely accepted for use in the life sciences,
    specifically for neuroscience. The DMM technology developed for this project will
    address the $165 million 2PM market by delivering an electrically tunable optic
    capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an
    order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities
    enabled by this technology will propel new research in the field of neuroscience
    aimed at solving widespread, chronic medical problems like stroke and Alzheimer's
    disease. Once the 2PM entry market is addressed, this technology will be refined
    to address the much larger $5.8 billion 3D laser printing market. \n\nDuring the
    Phase I project, new mirror coatings were developed to handle the high-power lasers
    used in 2PMs. With the core DMM technology in place, this Phase II project is
    aimed primarily at control of mirror actuation and shape for reliable use in 2PMs.
    The first objective of this Phase II project will develop electronics for robust
    control of mirror actuation and shape. Objective two will center on refining the
    core DMM technology and fabrication methods to enable position sensing of the
    membrane and improve mirror stroke to satisfy customers in 2PM markets. The final
    objective will involve the creation of optical and mechanical assemblies and modules
    for incorporating the DMM technology into key microscopes. The result of this
    Phase II will be a market-ready DMM product with active focus control to address
    the growing 2PM market.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

    This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

    Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project safeguards domestic food supply by improving honeybee health. Honeybees pollinate 1/3 of domestic food supply and contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy. Although honeybee populations are at a 20-year high in the U.S., the cost to keep them alive is at its historical peak.  This project reduces labor costs for commercial beekeepers, allowing them to devote more time to restoring hives that show signs of poor health and infestation. The product can be used to optimize hive placement, allowing growers to pollinate using the smallest number of hives. As growers' demand for hives decreases, the number of hives shipped across the country to pollinate crops will be reduced, resulting in a more robust stock of commercial honeybees.

    This proposed project expands on research developed in Phase I to grow the product from its first version into a scalable product, which includes predictive model improvements, additional data collection, mobile app development and additional field testing. A major component of the Phase II grant will be improving accuracy and performance of the hive strength model. Additional data collection will be important in Phase II to improve the model to perform well in a wider range of ambient conditions. By the end of Phase II, full automation of the software allows for the product to be used at all times. A major component of the Phase II work will be the development of a web-based mobile application that can take infrared pictures using smartphone camera attachments, upload images automatically to a database, and provide real time analytics on the images. This project is a breakthrough in the crop pollination space using infrared imagery that can be adapted to improve thermodynamic insights across many verticals.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to validate and test a novel blood-based diagnostic to detect unruptured brain aneurysms in asymptomatic patients. In the U.S., approximately 2-5% of the population (about 6-17 million Americans) harbors an unruptured brain aneurysm. Since aneurysms are largely asymptomatic, these individuals are unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, there are no adequate screening tools to identify an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA). As a result, ~30,000 Americans suffer aneurysm rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The novel diagnostic screening test to be validated in this project will provide a means to identify people who have unruptured aneurysms, enabling patients to be monitored and receive life-saving preventative treatments. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to validate a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms consisting of genes expressed in circulating whole blood. Our Phase I and Post-Phase I study results have shown that a panel of approximately 50 circulating RNAs isolated from blood samples can be used to predict the presence of unruptured brain aneurysms with over 90% accuracy. Since Phase I, analysis of these RNA biomarkers has been transferred and verified on a clinical diagnostic platform that uses patented chemical ligation-dependent probe amplification technology, standard qPCR amplification, and capillary electrophoresis for readout.  This Phase II project will be the first large-scale validation of this test, utilizing blood samples from 400 patients with and without aneurysms across 3 clinical centers to reliably assess the diagnostic's accuracy. Next-generation sequencing on the first half of patients will be used as a second verification of the platform and to select new emergent biomarkers if needed. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, the last half of the samples will be tested in a CLIA-certified lab in order to prepare the test for launch as a Lab Developed Test following Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to deliver a bio-based and functionally improved optical polymer that can be made into a lens. The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial
    interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically
    evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events.
    It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding
    of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning
    and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular
    reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical
    sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts
    climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate
    the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer
    industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems
    in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all
    sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined
    ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity
    of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the
    technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective
    of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate
    change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge
    gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for
    product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme
    precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer
    sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional
    hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change
    informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem
    through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial
    software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects
    to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated
    by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate,
    and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored
    software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment
    to be realized by using this platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    Â This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel probe-based direct transfer (PBDT) printing technology for manufacturing flexible hybrid electronic (FHE) devices. PBDT promises to deliver unprecedented selective, high-fidelity component transfer of a broad range of low-dimensional, high-performance electronic components with diverse architectures and sizes to flexible substrates. The technology will accelerate manufacturing capability to meet a critical need in the flexible and printed electronics market. The development of a stand-alone, automatic PBDT tool will provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers an unparalleled solution for integrating high-performance thin and ultra-thin electronic materials into next-generation flexible devices. The impact on the market and on daily life has the potential to be transformative, with everything from consumer devices (e.g., flexible phones and tablets), to imaging and sensing, to health care and homeland security being improved by advancements in flexible device manufacturing. Furthermore, PBDT will enable new directions in flexible device research and product development.Â 

    Â The overall objective of the Phase II project is to produce a prototype of a commercial version of a PBDT tool. In addition, detailed performance specs of the process and tool will be established, and functional FHE devices will be assembled using automated PBDT printing. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the PBDT approach of handling a flexible substrate as both a stamp and as the destination substrate allows for defect-free transfer of semiconductor components that are an order of magnitude thinner and more complex laterally than what conventional tools can handle. Based on the Phase I accomplishments, Phase II funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a prototype tool that will serve as the template for a fully automated commercial product. Successful commercialization of PBDT will require advances in PBDT processes and hardware; therefore, the specific objectives of the Phase II project are focused on (i) characterizing the full process space of PBDT technology, (ii) demonstrating a complete process flow for assembling and metalizing functional FHE devices, and (iii) validating the prototype in terms of printing rate and fidelity. The collaborating university partner will contribute to the design and fabrication of thin and ultra-thin silicon components to assess the performance of the tool and demonstrate viable FHE sensors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development and demonstration of a new manufacturing technology for lightweight bio-based plastics.  Plastic produced from plant materials can have lower environmental impact than petroleum-based plastics, but price and performance issues have limited their adoption. In Phase I, Grow Plastics demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, low cost, thermally stable 100% bio-based packaging products.  In Phase II, Grow Plastics will continue the development of its products while also working to develop a full-scale manufacturing line. The goal of the technology is to replace billions of pounds of petroleum-based plastic with a lower density plastic requiring half as much material, which is made from plants.

    This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to continue the development of a new manufacturing process for layered structures in biomaterials.  Grow Plastics has demonstrated the ability to generate novel, high-performance layered cellular structures in biopolymers in a new manufacturing process using new machinery.  The challenge in Phase II will be to continue the development in materials from Phase I while also scaling the technology to industrial scale.  Materials science and manufacturing techniques will include polymer blending, solid state foaming, and thermal crystallization of polymer blends. Analysis techniques will include tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo mechanical analysis, and evaluation of final product properties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop a medical device for valve replacement treatment of chronic insufficiency of the veins (CVI). Currently, no definitive treatment option exists to address the underlying cause of the disease, valvular reflux, which leaves millions of patients with chronic venous ulcers, skin thickening, and pain for years to decades. When brought to market, the proposed novel prosthetic valve and delivery system will provide a viable curative therapy superior to current treatment options and mitigating complications associated with existing valve prostheses, such as thrombosis and valve incompetence. The proposed product will curtail substantial health care expenditures associated with CVI, such as wound care, hospitalizations for infections, and associated secondary procedures. Because implantation of this valve does not require the complex or invasive surgical interventions of existing technologies, its use also will avoid expenses associated with open surgical procedures and rehabilitative care. The commercialization of this innovation is expected to benefit CVI patients, while significantly reducing costs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel, reliable, and marketable prosthetic valve and delivery system for the treatment of incompetent veins. In Phase I, a design was created for a device that exceeded laboratory and animal benchmarks. Phase II proposed development improves the design for broader deployment by demonstrating the the valve's ability to minimize thrombosis as well as the capability to be produced at scale. Phase II objectives are to:  1) Develop and produce the next generation valve for in vitro and animal testing; 2) Compare safety of valve designs in an in vitro study; 3) Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the leading design in a chronic animal study; 4) Complete biocompatibility testing on the design to ensure it is appropriate for human testing; and 5) Establish manufacturability of the device. These steps will provide the foundation for future clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the device in humans.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to help usher in personalized and tailored
    surgical care within a shifting healthcare context toward value-based care. Hospitals
    and surgeons are seeking solutions that will enable them to target, as opposed
    to generalizing, improvements in surgical quality for enhanced patient outcomes
    and effective use of resources. By proactively identifying surgical risks and
    matching patients to interventions most appropriate for these risk strata, the
    proposed technology is designed to support hospitals in meeting their value-based
    care objectives. The larger vision is to apply this paradigm in all of medicine
    by leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for prediction, proactive

    in a high-cost, high-risk specialty like surgery provides a path for expanding
    the technology into other medical specialties and serving a greater domestic and
    international market. Ultimately, the lessons learned from the wide-spread use
    of this technology will allow society to derive key kernels of knowledge in applied

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from improved financial resilience of hundreds of thousands of water-dependent businesses and municipalities currently threatened by hydrologic volatility and severely strained ecosystems. This SBIR research will enable the seamless integration of scientific and financial modeling for the water economy. The innovation lowers the costs and improves the performance of two climate risk mitigation investments: 1) Green Infrastructure (projects that emulate or protect nature in order to ensure clean water supply for commercial and public use); and 2) weather insurance contracts, which provide businesses and utilities with financial relief from droughts and floods that hamper their operations. With 50% of the global population projected to face water scarcity by 2050 (according to the UN), and $10B in economic value destroyed annually by floods, droughts, freezes in the US, these new approaches to risk mitigation are crucial to reducing water demand stresses through a free-market approach to water resource conservation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to eliminate technical barriers currently hindering seamless data and model integration for hydrology and finance. The Phase I project validated technical feasibility by demonstrating the utility of a semantic web technology to provide end-to-end modeling solutions for quantifying hydro-financial risk. Phase I established that the technology 1) greatly improves the interoperability between massive heterogeneous data sets and models for quantifying hydrologic-financial risk, and 2) enables data and models to be linked through a tamper-proof distributed network. The Phase II project builds on the technological foundation to deploy a production environment for running a suite of models encompassing ecosystem services, hydrology, and actuarial sciences. The project builds foundations for AI-enabled decision support tools. If successful, this research will enable significant reductions in the time and costs associated with modeling the financial value of investment in natural water infrastructure, generating comparisons between a wide range of water projects and financial structures seamlessly and without compromising scientific rigor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to more completely understand the real world through a perfect virtual copy. This SBIR Phase II project makes it possible to create virtual reproductions of real cities that not only show how the world looks, but reproduce every object and every detail perfectly, allowing users to interact with it. These virtual copies make it possible to quickly and effectively train soldiers and first responders, train autonomous ground and flying vehicles, place new construction into a dense city, simulate the effects of catastrophic weather, and explore imaginary scenarios through games. Billions of dollars are already spent mapping and 3D modeling the real world for these and many other applications, but these virtual cities are created through painstaking manual methods that can take months to years, or lack necessary information about what is in the world. This SBIR Phase II project will make it possible to rapidly and automatically create detailed 3D copies of any area of the real world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed 3D models of the world for diverse commercial applications. This project introduces new methods for turning raw multimodal sensor data into semantic information describing the world and immersive, interactive-ready 3D models. It will remove the time, money, and manual effort necessary to create accurate 3D models of real world areas today, by using computer intelligence instead of human effort to parse sensor data like photographs and laser scans. The resulting 3D models and underlying semantic information describing the world will be used directly in game engines and simulation software, in analysis tools, in rendering software, and beyond. This research will build on the associated Phase I project, first improving the detail that can be identified and reproduced in virtual copies of the real world, then showing readiness for commercialization with paying customers. The result of the project will be a market-ready product for an initial market segment, capable of accurately reproducing real cities in 3D models that customers can readily use, as well as traction that demonstrates customer need for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is helping Community Cancer Centers serving the estimated 65% of patients receiving radiation therapies.  Cancer is still the second leading cause of death in the United States.  Currently accomplished only by significant investment in new equipment, successful therapy hinges upon the ability to delineate and adapt to a precise tumor location "on the day of" radiation delivery. Community Centers cannot afford to replace existing machines with more accurate and expensive modalities.  Especially in rural communities with limited resources, few people diagnosed with cancer can afford to travel and incur the cost of staying 4-6 weeks in a local hotel to receive daily treatments from state of the art technologies located only in the wealthy institutions.  Using a novel cloud-based architecture and proprietary software, this Phase II award will allow remote clinics, and any hospital, to treat patients with highly improved real-time accuracy. By enabling their existing radiotherapy machines to deliver an adaptive dose to the current location of the tumor, radiation oncologists can significantly improve treatment efficacy, a patient's quality of life, reduce patient re-hospitalizations, and reduce the cost of therapy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the unmet need to see daily changes in anatomy throughout the course of cancer radiation treatment and effectively target only the tumor. Today, a physician designs a treatment plan and dose prescription based on images that are captured days or even weeks prior to initiation of radiation therapy, creating a margin of error around the tumor that encompasses healthy tissues.  Unaccounted anatomical changes are quite frequent, leading to a diminished quality of treatment delivery, inferior outcomes, and a decreased quality of life. The phase I project investigated and developed a treatment-equipment agnostic approach to adapt the treatment to account for these anatomical changes. Phase II will focus on integrating artificial intelligence and deep neural analytics to predict two critical parameters for the treatment adaptivity: (a) treatment prognostics and (b) registration error quantification. Leveraging the company's cloud based, scalable, GPU computational framework, the project will develop and integrate patient-specific biomechanical models to automatically validate results and accurately predict future trends in patient-specific anatomical changes.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  A Dynamic Real-Time Analytics Recruiting Platform'
- abstractText: "Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) offers tremendous benefit for rapid
    prototyping, mass customization, and low cost fabrication. This creates an untapped
    opportunity to develop the technology further to support low volume industrial
    manufacturing for price sensitive and emerging markets. The ability to source
    locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings into
    a printer rather than extruded filament is extremely advantageous for both manufacturer
    and end user in regards to reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping.
    The benefits of this innovation is amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial
    objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale products
    represent a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are ~ 1/10th
    the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet extrusion
    is it addresses the need to print faster. Finally, a dependence on extruded thermoform
    plastics limits the available library for printing and the ability to mix materials
    to engineer new formulations. With domain expertise in large-scale 3D FFF printing,
    re:3D proposes to evolve a prototype pellet 3D printer developed under Phase I
    to be able to address all of these needs by coupling direct drive pellet extrusion
    technology with a grinder, dryer and feeding system optimized for reclaimed plastics.
    \n\n\nre:3D intends to leverage Phase I research conducted on material requirements
    for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), two of the most available
    reclaimed plastics worldwide, to further optimize the pellet printer to be able
    to accept reclaimed flake as well as non uniform pellets. This effort will include
    developing the ability to consistently dry the input materials and to easily clean
    and switch between materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of
    pellets and/or flake into the platform will also be developed with the requisite
    controls. Once complete, the company will pilot the solution in Texas through
    IC2 as well as in Puerto Rico, an island territory with a complicated supply chain,
    in conjunction with waste streams/partners identified by the Puerto Rico Science
    & Research Trust. The new hardware integration solutions developed in Phase 2
    will be incorporated into the Phase I prototype platform which leveraged Michigan
    Technological University's (MTU) prior work conducting validation and materials
    testing in Phase I, prior work modifying direct drive recyclebots for FFF 3D printers,
    and open source firmware and software research. To ensure excellence, prototypes
    will be extensively tested using MTU's facilities with reclaimed PP and PET in
    prints to be used for casting, mold production and load bearing applications.
    Once the prototype design for commercial scalability has been validated at MTU
    and field-tested, all progress will be openly documented and shared in an effort
    to scale the solution suite to multiple platforms as quickly as possible. The
    hardware will be sold commercially after completing the project as both an integrated
    3D printing solution and also as independent hardware due to the potential to
    be applied beyond Cartesian 3D printing systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "Diesel engines remain critical to global economies, but are under
    threat from increasingly-stringent emissions regulations. Many alternatives, like
    spark-ignition and electric vehicles, sacrifice some of the performance or range
    benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for technologies
    that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled from the
    dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development of the
    ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that enables
    Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol and
    methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel combustion.
    Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol and ethanol
    obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric
    air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx
    (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any market
    dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture,
    rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with,
    OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results
    have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out
    soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling under
    the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS. The
    Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation,
    alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric
    combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to
    achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low emissions.
    This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and demonstrate
    the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using CFD modeling and
    engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared to the Diesel baseline.
    The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder heavy-duty engine to
    simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss of efficiency, while also
    achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions that are compatible with
    low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the same system that enables
    gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner than Diesel). A Phase II prototype
    demonstration would realize a longtime industry goal of integrating three-way
    catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing Diesel-style engines to achieve
    the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives (like natural gas).\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of an analysis method
    and software package to identify human disease subtypes using omics data.  This
    technology will enable the ability to provide personalized treatment for patients,
    and more successful and cost-effective clinical trials, bring drugs to market
    more rapidly.  The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups,
    a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger
    and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment
    because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently,
    70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more
    than $1 trillion per year. This may be avoided by refining trial inclusion criteria
    and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology
    is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond
    to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic
    clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to
    achieve sufficient power. The technology will significantly reduce drug development
    costs while simultaneously improving patient care by selecting the correct treatment
    for each patient. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is
    to develop a novel analysis method and software package that is able to identify

    Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because
    of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents
    vs. non-respondents) and/or subtypes of disease (aggressive vs. non-aggressive).
    The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and
    subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression
    signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene
    expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be
    used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple
    types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real
    patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more
    and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This
    Phase II project proposes to extend this technology to integrate genomic and clinical

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device
    for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites
    are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and
    the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity,
    increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling
    tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality
    product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural
    integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have
    a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from
    composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance
    on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy.
    Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites.
    This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share
    of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing
    equally fast, if not faster. \n\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued
    the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult
    (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with
    different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger
    products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited
    the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype
    and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The
    Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central
    base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the
    use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully
    tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype
    unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field
    trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production.
    In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements
    was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed
    and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will fully develop and market a digital language tool previously found effective in helping non-native English speakers acquire language skills. It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


    An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable
    method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production
    is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals,
    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise
    marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture
    and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities
    and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale
    algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges
    in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased
    operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities
    will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for
    reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to
    maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus
    design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;
    3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the
    need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder
    to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the
    basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater
    use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The
    target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of
    sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a
    minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system
    will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated
    CO2."

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

    During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of software to help bioscientists analyze more tissue in less time and with higher accuracy and reproducibility.  Currently, stereology studies require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen, making tedious manual counts (clicks) on hundreds to thousands of microscopic cells. The technology under development uses a series of algorithms that combine unbiased stereology with a powerful new approach - deep learning (artificial intelligence) - to quantify stereology changes in stained cells in an objective, faster and more reproducible manner than existing methods.  A major advantage of automating stereology using an objective deep learning approach is the savings in time and costs currently required of a trained technician to collect data. This technology will improve the pace of research into the causes of human diseases and accelerate the development of novel strategies for the therapeutic management of afflicted patients.  Bioscientists and medical scientists will better serve the needs of society for a greater understanding of cellular structure in health, aging and disease, while the technology will ensure accurate and precise stereology results without the need for highly trained data collectors and at a small fraction of the time and cost of existing approaches.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop software to automate the collection of stereology data in biomedical and bioscience research.  The results of the Phase I research showed that tissue sections were automatically counted over 10X times faster with equal accuracy as manual stereology.  In addition, reproducibility was 99% and required little or no user training.  The Phase II objectives are to develop standardized, high-throughput, deep learning networks for quantifying other stereology parameters of stained cells and tissues, validate active deep learning as a technique for customizing deep learning for all user staining protocols, and update the software and documentation to support user-friendly workflow. The aim is to train the neural network to accurately segment a wider range of cell and tissue pathology with variable morphologies with a performance metric for accuracy of 95%.  Unbiased stereology will allow bioscientists to accurately quantify the cellular changes that cause metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, toxic reactions and mental illnesses.  Automating the process of collecting stereology data will accelerate scientific research, toxicology studies and drug development, and bring significant benefits to society through scientific breakthroughs and medical discoveries.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new technologies to
    manufacture personalized therapies for cancer and other diseases, based on a patient's
    own cells.  Such therapies have shown tremendous potential in the treatment of
    previously intractable cancers.  However, challenges in manufacturing these completely
    personalized therapies are a significant impediment to the ability to realize
    their full societal potential both in terms of therapeutic efficacy and cost.
    \ This project aims to remove major manufacturing barriers for therapies based
    on dendritic cells, which are an important part of the human immune system and
    can be modified to target specific diseases.  No manufacturing systems currently
    available can perform all the required steps of manufacturing personalized dendritic
    cell therapies.  This project will address this major unmet need by leveraging
    advanced concepts in engineering and biology to design an integrated system for
    cost-effective dendritic cell therapy manufacturing.  Given the large number of
    personalized cell-based therapies currently in clinical trials and recently approved,
    such a system is expected to address a major societal need and have significant
    commercial potential.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will advance to commercialization
    an advanced bioreactor system for closed-system manufacturing of autologous dendritic
    cell therapies.  Multiple technological challenges must be overcome to automate
    and integrate the unit operations associated with the manufacturing of these therapies.
    \ Because of their low abundance in blood and tissue, dendritic cells are typically
    generated from leukapheresis-derived monocytes.  Adherent monocytes must first
    be converted into nonadherent immature dendritic cells via incubation inIL4 and
    GM-CSF, prior to maturation and stimulation with tumor specific antigens. In order
    to achieve automation and integration of these steps on a single platform, the
    proposed system will build on successful Phase I work in perfusion-based dendritic
    cell culture that enables reduction of process steps associated with cytokine
    infusion and achievement of perfusion in a simple and cost-effective single-use
    bioreactor design.  In addition, an agile product development methodology will
    be utilized in conjunction with computational modeling to rapidly and iteratively
    create prototypes and test them in the hands of potential customers.  Feedback
    obtained from these users will be incorporated into the assembly of a pre-production
    beta system to be launched commercially at the end of Phase II.\n\nThis award

    Phase II project will be achieved through creation of a new way of teaching abstract
    scientific concepts, like electricity and magnetism, and presenting them in an

    combined circuit and field simulator built in Phase I. The phase II research will
    include adapting the existing simulator to cover additional topics covered in
    middle school and high school physics, for example: semiconductors, solar panels,
    LEDs, transistors, logic circuits, memory, computers, etc. This innovation is
    a complex simulator that allows users to \"play\" with charges, conductors, magnets,
    generators, motors, and particle accelerators. This allows the user to feel confident
    with the concepts before they dive into the complex mathematical equations behind

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be in lowering the overall cost of lithium-ion batteries. Material cost reduction drives greater adoption of technologies using batteries such as electric vehicles and storage systems while increasing the use of renewables.  Cathode material is a battery's largest cost contributor, and with the market growing 10+% year-over-year, producers are having to spend millions of dollars in plant expansions to meet this increased demand. Technology solutions that allow cathode material producers to cost effectively expand current production capacity without investment or sacrificing quality or performance are immediately needed in this industry.  Current industry processes require lengthy high-temperature production steps that consume large amounts of energy throughout the production process.  This phase II project is focused on developing a "one-pot" manufacturing process that will address the current market priorities of lowering production costs, shortening manufacturing times, increasing production yield and using sustainable materials, allowing cathode producers to significantly increase profit margins while addressing demand for increased production.  More broadly, lower battery costs will increase the adoption of technologies that utilize lithium-ion batteries and enable greater implementation of other renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to develop a breakthrough, sustainable, "one-pot" process for the manufacture of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.  This manufacturing process will capitalize on the opportunity within the cathode production to address its needs for lowering production costs, increasing production capacity, and reducing energy consumption.  The Phase II project will involve (i) the optimization of the manufacturing process, as measured by half-cell battery performance screening, (ii) demonstrate doubling throughput and providing cost savings of at least 20% over current production processes for NMC 622, (iii) demonstrate battery performance that is equivalent to, or better than, that of a commercial benchmark in full cell testing, and (iv) design and construction of a pilot reactor.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a novel assistive technology to the neuromuscular market. Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.

    The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects). Objective 2 testing will include measurement of accuracy/error rates and performance-time, for participants with ALS interacting with AAC tools including integration of the device. It is anticipated that software/firmware developments and other enhancements in Phase II will improve accuracy and latency of the device, in comparison to models produced in Phase I, and show usability effect in real-world user testing as part of a full AAC solution to improve communication capabilities for ALS patients.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will help scientists gain a better
    understanding of the underlying relationships in their data and as a result help
    humans make better decisions from data. The advantage of big data is that it allows
    for the possibility of identifying truly meaningful relationships. Exposing these
    relationships can provide great benefits for many different problem domains, and
    therefore has high commercial appeal in applications such as fraud detection in
    credit card or insurance data, drug discovery, and identifying threats to national
    security in homeland security data. Identifying previously unseen relationships
    also plays a big part in scientific research and discovery. Great scientific discoveries
    come from a deep understanding of the world around us. Data can capture these
    relationships, but this is only useful if a researcher can identify them. This
    motivates the need for sophisticated tools that can present these relationships

    which can introduce a significant amount of noise and conflicting relationships.
    This problem is compounded in time varying datasets as some relationships can
    be inconsistent and disappear over time. There is hence a great need to find and

    Phase II project will accomplish this by developing a set of novel interactive
    visualizations that will find these consistent relationships and explain how they
    change over time. It will use causal analysis and also extend it to the temporal
    domain in which causes with delayed effects will be identified (e.g. smoking causes
    cancer after many decades). Finally, as these data mining techniques can be very
    computationally expensive, this Phase II project will develop useful optimizations
    to make them more efficient. The company expects that the results of this research
    will enable scientists and consequently end users to identify previously unseen

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is improved health and lowered cost of care for 15 million babies who are born prematurely or severely underweight each year. These 'premies' require weeks or months of care in specialized hospital units (e.g. NICU). In the United States, a typical NICU stay costs about $80K, and the total cost of healthcare during the first year of life is about $16B annually. These babies are at elevated risk for a range of serious lifelong complications that economically burden society by over $30B. This project has the potential to make a substantial impact to one of the most core vital elements of neonatal growth and development by improving the baby's sleep-wake-feed cycle. Today that cycle is irregular, episodic and disrupted almost 80% of the time which prolongs hospitalization. If successful, this project and technology would provide clinicians with a new tool and approach to help babies establish regularity, build up more energy and take on more calories so they can be discharged 20% faster. More importantly, this technology could lower the rate of downstream neuro developmental complications which are linked directly to poor sleep patterns.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a simple miniature wearable patch and display system that clinicians can use to monitor neonatal sleep and development patterns. This new tool will help clinicians achieve their goals of improving sleep-wake-feed cycles. In Phase I the team developed a prototype sensor configured to work on tiny babies and demonstrated that it could be used to accurately measure sleep cycles. In Phase II, the main objective is to advance the design and performance of this instrument to enable routine reliable use. It should be simple and non-intrusive for any clinician to reliably position the sensor and monitor any baby for multi-day periods. Analysis data should be presented real-time in an easy-to-interpret and actionable format. The work includes further biomedical engineering to improve attachment, amplifier circuit modelling to widen dynamic range and signal processing to automate artifact handling. The team will develop and test machine learning routines that will display detailed accurate and reliable instantaneous and trend data of brainstem-based sleep patterns that are not available today. These new advances, built on novel brainstem biomeasures will open up broad adoption supporting the development of a business and substantial medical advances.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  Non-invasive Neonatal Brainstem Monitoring to Improve Sleep,
    Minimize Disruptions and Enhance Feeding Stamina Leading to Earlier Discharge
    and Healthier Development'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable the creation of a powerful, simple
    to use, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) device needed to facilitate a dramatic
    reduction in water waste and damage, transform maintenance from responsive to
    predictive, and improve the health and quality of life for residents. This project
    will revolutionize how we track and manage water usage, improve conservation,
    eliminate water waste, and lower overall operating and maintenance costs. At the
    same time, the new monitoring system enables large reductions in water consumption,
    electricity utilization and carbon generation relative to water production, transmission,
    distribution and recycling. This will improve the water system just as electrical
    usage and monitoring dramatically improved energy consumption for buildings, i.e.
    in lighting systems. The data analytics solution is scalable within all water
    fixtures Most importantly, it can be cost-effectively produced in the U.S. and
    create sustainable, green jobs. We envision this project will eliminate the need
    for replacing water fixture parts on a schedule because we don?t know when or
    how things fail, and it will enable Smart Buildings and Smart Cities to protect
    an increasingly scarce and expensive resource. \n\nThe proposed project will build
    upon the successful technical and customer discoveries from Phase I to develop
    the ability for a building owner to know when a leak occurs in a water fixture
    before it does damage, wastes a precious resource, or creates a potential health
    risk. In Phase I, we demonstrated a Minimum Viable Product that is essentially
    a ?smoke alarm for water fixtures? that provides a building owner alerts when
    a water fixture presents signs of a leak, before it does damage. The device is
    inside an affordable platform can be economically produced in the U.S. Current
    estimates are that ~23% of water produced is wasted and does damage in the process.
    Building owners seek a solution that will conserve water, reduce costs and improve
    their environmental impact. In Phase II, we will measure water from drips to flowing
    water, develop an IoT device that is simple to install and use, develop powerful
    analytics for predictive rather than reactive maintenance, and generate data valued
    by insurance companies and property owners. Data analytics can make the water
    delivery and consumption process considerably more reliable, and reduce loss and
    damage significantly.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to directly and positively impact the speed of chemical analysis leading to cleaner and more advanced products. Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a fast, efficient, and scalable cell engineering technology that is easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots.  Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application and administrative portal to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically, elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop and test a multiplatform, personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support. The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards associated with Earth and Space Science. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the Public. Given these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry.


    This project will produce a multiplatform reading application to support science learning. The key innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners. This Phase II project has five technical goals: (a) develop and test the e-reader to work via tablet and mobile web; (b) develop and test enhanced reading features; (c) develop and test administrative and payment portals; (d) develop and curate NGSS-aligned content and assessments; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers. During Phase II, the project team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation to market. The key features of the interactive reading application create a potential for unnecessary memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is providing secure access to multi-tiered users. This technical challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to allow for secure, multiple group membership, ensuring data visibility and security. A diverse SquidBooks team, with expertise in business, software design and engineering, educational research and measurement, science education, writing, and science will achieve these goals of this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.

    The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


    This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

    The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance infrastructure for research and education by exposing a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables
    the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction
    based on a novel photomodification technique called \"LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive
    Index Change).\" More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive
    error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to
    refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however
    there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing
    glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact
    lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their
    thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability
    and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision
    correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material,
    enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses.
    LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local
    medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea.
    LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular
    material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. \n\nChanging the
    refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several
    fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision
    care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability
    with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and
    irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia,
    and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial
    resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs
    can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients
    viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual
    acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of
    the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process
    speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
    that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively
    do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555
    nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

    There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a probiotic treatment that may be used to reduce or eliminates Salmonella and other infections in poultry. The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

    This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.

    to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing
    a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered
    devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with
    10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on
    batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology
    is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can
    be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience
    to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery
    space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power
    electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices
    (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding
    market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection,
    power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power
    transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery
    replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and
    money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. \n\nThe work
    of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance
    of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production
    and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit
    design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption,
    low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone.
    In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested
    using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and
    power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified
    at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional
    transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product.
    The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes
    needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete
    MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol
    while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    on the development of a low-cost, wireless, and energy harvesting environmental
    sensor, and a data aggregation / visualization platform to enable effective communication
    of data to users and control systems. This project addresses major barriers in
    our main market, the application of IoT to the buildings sector, where complexity
    is encountered in the placement and powering of sensors in monitoring locations
    where access is limited. By reducing the upfront and maintenance costs of wireless
    sensor networks, the project allows cost-effective building sensor data collection
    of unprecedented longevity and density. These rich data sets in turn enable myriad
    benefits, including more effective building management controls and in-depth automated
    energy evaluations. The commercial availability of a low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting
    environmental sensor would enable high-granularity sensing, feedback, and control
    to several additional markets including industrial, agricultural, and any other
    market application that would benefit from monitoring where power or access is
    in short supply. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project

    and a beta data visualization platform. Phase II of the program aims to expand
    the scope of the low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor from
    a network of low-power, short-range devices to a plug-and-play building-wide sensing
    solution, which includes the incorporation of additional hardware elements, including
    routers to extend the range of the low-power devices, and the development of automated
    data analysis strategies to extract valuable building information for the end-user."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II is to improve the mobility of wheelchair users.  There are more than 2.5 M wheelchair users in the US. This project will develop an electronic aftermarket add-on accessory to increase manual wheelchair usersâ height up to 18 inches or more in 5 seconds. The new wheelchair lift (WL) will increase their Quality of Life and their ability to independently perform activities of daily living (feeding, bathing, dressing) and instrumental activities of daily living (transportation, shopping, cooking, doing laundry, and housework). The solution will replace expensive home retrofitting ($20 K) and will reduce the need for help in outside settings, such as reaching for items on shelves, empowering the users. The WL will bridge the gap between the disabled and the able-bodied population, providing a means to increase wheelchair usersâ participation in the labor force (currently only 20%) and enabling more employment options. Similarly, the WL will offer employers an effective way to support workers with disabilities and reduce costs to adapt the work environment to provide reasonable accommodations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to generate a final functional prototype of the wheelchair lift (WL) ready for usability tests with end-users. The Phase II project extends prior work on a prototype satisfying the major design specifications of weight, lift maximum load, and time of ascension, de-risking the most significant technological challenges associated with the project. The proposed activities will enable systems engineering of hardware and electronics development and the next generation prototype for testing and regulatory clearance. The prototype will be produced under Quality Management Systems and an industrial manufacturing process will be established.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide domestic production of renewable, biomass-based alternatives to products currently made from oil.  This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the commercial potential of producing 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), a key chemical used to manufacture coatings, adhesives, and plastics, from agricultural wastes like corn cobs. Biomass-based chemicals can decrease the nation's dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while providing cost-competitive high-performance chemical products. Creating high-value commodity chemicals using nonfood agricultural materials as feedstock promises to create new markets for bio-based waste products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will generate the necessary experimental data to design commercial reactors for producing renewable bio-based 1,5-pentanediol. A chemical pathway to produce bio-based 1,5-pentanediol has been demonstrated in laboratory reactors using commercially relevant reactors and catalysts.  In this work a wide range of reactor operating conditions will be explored in the laboratory for scale-up of the process. These operating conditions will be further demonstrated in larger pilot-scale equipment to inform design at commercial scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-life for pancreatic cancer patients. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer survive five years after diagnosis because most cases are detected at later stages when clinical interventions are relatively ineffective. Earlier detection improves interventions, prevents unnecessary procedures arising from uncertain diagnosis, and leads to health system cost savings. Roughly 5 million individuals in the US are at higher risk, but there is no screening test available today for earlier stages, a surveillance market estimated at $3 B. This project will develop a diagnostic test for surveillance of people at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, with methods potentially applicable to other types of cancer and other diseases.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a technology using a small blood sample to detect the functional state of multiple biological signaling pathways known to participate in cancer inception and progression. This technology can analyze these low abundance proteins at a low cost suitable for a widely adopted surveillance test.  A purpose-built bioinformatic system analyses and compares the bio-signature identified by the assay across many individuals.  This Phase II project will optimize the panel of protein targets in the assay to detect high-performing differential bio-signatures for early stages of the disease, and it will enhance the machine-learning-based matching methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project may be a fundamental shift in academic and life outcomes for students, especially those from low-income and vulnerable populations, by building metacognition and Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. This project will advance the company's technology that builds critical SEL and metacognition skills in a way that is student-led and integrated with academic content and routines.  The effort expands teacher capacity in a measurable way. The project will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the companyâs proprietary data of student reflections and teacher feedback, will train Machine Learning (ML) driven predictive algorithms to measure reflection quality and will build a learning strategies recommendation engine. This innovation will allow teachers and students to expand their toolkits of effective pedagogically-sound learning strategies. The deeper application of the innovation unlocks commercialization potential coupled with transformational outcomes for student learning.


    The Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support the feasibility and commercialization of applying NLP techniques and ML algorithms based on the companyâs proprietary data to âreadâ student reflections, rate them on a quality rubric, and help teachers provide feedback. Stage I of this project will be a lower effort, fast value objective to apply data science and analytics to roll-up real-time quality assessments to measure growth at the student.  The project will provide reports on the reflection quality to school administrators and feedback tips to teachers based on student reflection quality and classroom context. Stage II would be a higher effort.  One objective will be to build a Strategy Recommendation Engine driven by NLP and ML techniques and based on the latest research in pedagogy and learning sciences. This technology will analyze past reflections to identify which learning strategies a student has tried, then provide teachers with suggestions on pedagogy-driven strategies they can be recommended to improve the students' learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve diagnosis of pediatric otitis media (ear infection).  Otitis media is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children and the second most common pediatric physician appointment.  It is estimated that more than 90% of children will suffer at least one case of otitis media before age 5.  Despite its prevalence, there may be less than 60% diagnostic accuracy in primary care where the vast majority of cases are seen.  Current clinical diagnostics have proven inadequate to address over-prescription of antibiotics and unnecessary specialist and surgical referrals. Otitis media is typically diagnosed using an otoscope to view the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and assess visual signs of an infection.  Otoscope designs have changed little since the 1800âs.  This SBIR Phase II project advances a novel device that integrates clinical standard otoscopy with a novel technique to non-invasively assess ear health using light in real time and with 98% accuracy.  This new otoscope has the potential to create a new standard of care in diagnosis and management of otitis media, and stands to save billions in direct healthcare costs through more accurate diagnosis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a device providing clinicians with an objective, real-time indicator of ear health during standard otoscopy.  At the push of a button, the LED driven measurement will provide an instantaneous, accurate indication of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE) â the most sensitive and specific indicator of acute otitis media per established clinical guidelines.  This project will meet the desired technical specifications of sufficiently sensitive visualization capabilities and reducing measurement time from 1.4 seconds to less than 300 milliseconds.  This project will also: 1) Optimize manufacturability and assembly; 2) Develop a standard automated calibration system; and 3) Conduct standard electronic, photobiologic, and biocompatibility testing for safety and regulatory purposes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help more amputees walk safely with less effort. Approximately 800,000 individuals live with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. The 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee have two options:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The first option requires that the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter does so automatically but cost $30,000-100,000 and requires physical qualification, limiting the availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with any leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. This project will explore the trade space of mechanical and analytical capabilities.  This project will validate intuitive movement and universal stability for above-knee amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work will advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help enable the expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) through new peel-and-stick sensor nodes.  Such IoT nodes require low device cost, and thus low sub-component costs for sensing elements, processing circuits, communications, and power. In addition, they are power constrained, requiring minimal energy consumption during sensor data collection, processing, and transmission. Integrating low-cost and low-power components into a single size-limited device becomes a substantial challenge using conventional semiconductor fabrication materials and processes. This SBIR Phase II project will use a novel System-on-Foil approach that patterns efficient silicon circuitry directly into a novel flexible silicon substrate, alongside low-cost printed electronics. This approach enables the integration of all core IoT elements, including microprocessors, sensors, antennas, interconnects, and power supplies, making robust systems with applications in condition monitoring for civil infrastructure, human health monitoring, automotive, grid battery management, wind turbines, aerospace, and industrial equipment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel semiconductor recrystallization technology to support a new generation of flexible electronics. To include on-board processing, communication, and memory circuitry, current state-of-the-art flexible electronics rely on surface mounting and soldering of off-the-shelf silicon chips, similar to rigid printed circuit board assemblies. This pick-and-place approach not only reduces device flexibility, but also leads to interconnection challenges that severely compromise device reliability.  This project leverages a thin film recrystallization process where equivalent silicon circuits can now be patterned directly into flexible silicon, resulting in a highly scalable manufacturing process that drastically improves device reliability. By patterning all components directly into a high-temperature substrate, conformal electronics can be made that are durable even in heavy vibration and shock environments.  The project objectives include the transition of prototype recrystallization processes to a higher throughput and higher quality pilot-scale recrystallization system. The resulting flexible silicon substrates will then be used for preliminary development of integrated circuit fabrication to produce active silicon components as a step toward fully patterned System-on-Foil electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to save significant amounts of water at power plants and other industrial facilities, potentially saving hundreds of billions of gallons of water every year in the US. This will help reduce the water footprint of power generation and other cooling applications, reduce operating expenses for these facilities, and increase the reliability of power generation. The annual savings can be several millions of dollars per facility and the market opportunity in the US is estimated at around $4 B. Furthermore, this technology can be used for upcycling the captured water from cooling towers that use wastewater or seawater, potentially producing pure distilled water for commercial and domestic use.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance a water capture technology for cooling tower plumes. The proposed technology uses electric fields to ionize the air around a cooling tower outlet, charge the water escaping cooling towers, and direct it toward a mesh-based collector and ultimately a collection tank on the periphery of the cooling tower. The Phase II proposal includes both systematic experimental studies to optimize the collection setup for real-world deployment, as well as material choice and durability studies. This project will optimize the design and build a pilot system, including a control panel designed for compatibility with existing systems.  Data collected from the pilot installation on collection efficiency, water quality, and power consumption will be used to iterate and improve the design.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project continues from Phase I to realize a new surgical tool system to enable safe and precise delivery of stem cells and genes for ophthalmic application, specifically to repair and restore vision for patients with retinal degeneration. Visual impairment occurs in the natural course of aging, with some conditions potentially addressed surgically.  Associated improvements in both quality of life and reduced health care expenditures can be addressed with a system involving augmented real-time visualization technology, tools capable of minute actions, and smart algorithms informing surgical actions.  The proposed technology improves imaging by incorporating machine vision, with applications in ophthalmic treatment and beyond.

    This SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided sub-retinal injector system.  Technical tasks include conducting studies to test clinical safety and procedure efficacy on both cadaveric human eyes and in-vivo porcine eyes.  Specifically, trained surgeons will use the system to validate the capability to execute tasks related to subretinal microinjection procedures, determine the time to task completion, and characterize the magnitude and frequency of errors.  The system will be validated with histology samples and compared to current the standard of care of freehand performance.

    immune response obtained through previous childhood vaccination or past infections
    to target tumor cells for cancer eradication. Globally, cancer continues to be
    one of the top five leading causes of death, resulting in a high unmet need for
    novel therapies and treatments. Blockade of immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs
    have emerged as a potent solution with demonstrated clinical benefits. However,
    such treatments are expensive and toxic. Furthermore, many patients are ineligible,
    do not respond, or acquired resistance to such drugs due to the absence of an
    anti-tumor response. In contrast, our strategy tailors the patientâs tumor to
    become susceptible toward pre-existing anti-pathogenic or childhood vaccine immunity.
    Our approach will change or extend treatment opportunities for many cancer patients.
    This also circumvents the risky and costly R&D challenges in identifying and/or
    producing potent immune responses against cancer.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of a lead AIR that could
    redirect different viral immune memory responses toward tumors in vitro, and in
    vivo with mouse tumor models. Phase II will advance the development: (1) Advanced
    optimization coupled with characterization studies will be performed on our current
    product and purification methods to further define a consistent process compatible
    with scaled manufacturing; (2) we will initiate more in-depth non-clinical safety
    and toxicology studies to ensure the AIR solution achieves the required safety
    attributes; and (3) we will perform additional in vivo studies in animal tumor
    models more aligned with the initial target application. The proposed approach
    potentially serves as an âoff the shelfâ immunotherapy based on the patientâs
    individual health/vaccine history, thereby extending additional treatment opportunities
    to a broader cancer patient population.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is enabling commercialization of novel technologies
    that convert pectin-rich agricultural byproducts into useful specialty chemicals
    for existing multi-billion dollar chemical markets. The United States is a leading
    producer of pectin-rich byproducts, including the citrus (>5 million tons annually),
    apple (>5 million tons annually) and sugar beet (>37 million tons annually) industries.
    With this platform fermentation technology, it is possible to perform specific
    chemical conversion of these US byproducts into value-adding products. Implementation
    of this technology can increase overall revenue from crops far exceeding current
    byproduct mitigation strategies. This offers reduced volatility in crop value,
    financial sustainability for farmers, and construction of rural fermentation facilities.
    Furthermore, by using existing crop byproducts and eco-friendly fermentations,
    the resulting chemical products will be have lower environmental impact than competing
    chemicals made from petroleum or sugar.\n \nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to improve the conversion of industrial pectin-rich
    agricultural byproducts into specialty chemical products. Each year, large volumes
    of agricultural byproducts, such as citrus peels and sugar beet pulp are produced,
    but lack value-adding technologies. By using novel scientific breakthroughs in
    microbial metabolism and tools for strain engineering, microbial organisms can
    be engineered to convert the sugars from these byproducts into useful chemicals
    through environmentally sustainable fermentation. The goal of this Phase II project
    is to improve the production rate for the synthesis of the first chemical product
    using this technology. The first objective is to improve the oxidative metabolism
    of the host organism to aid in strain productivity. The second objective is to
    use a combinatorial library of strains to refine and optimize the microorganisms'
    fermentation rate. The final objective is to take the improved strains and optimize
    the fermentation conditions using bioreactors. This three pronged-approach promises
    to improve chemical production rates.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

This project will advance the development of waterproof multi-articulated hands with a touch feedback system, offering an affordable solution to restore confidence and independence to over 10 million amputees worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the work done in Phase I to develop an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. The work in this proposal will involve advanced mechanical design techniques necessary for waterproofing a multi-articulated prosthetic hand. Additionally, the project will advance the development of a variable grip strength, semi-automatic contact reflex system to improve the range of manipulation tasks possible with upper limb prosthetic devices. Technical tasks include: 1) development of contact reflexes through integration of position control, pressure sensing interface, and speed control for both fine, compliant manipulation of delicate objects and gross manipulation of objects requiring high grip force; 2) waterproofing to an IP67 rating, a significant technical challenge because of the many potential points of ingress and required level of manufacturing precision;  3) the mobile application user interface; and 4) standardization for manufacturing at scale.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the development of a scalable, universal quantum computing platform. The range of applications are broad and will expand in parallel with the development of new quantum algorithms, with initial applications including molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, currently limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, quantum computing must be significantly scaled. The proposed system will develop a new method to trap and control individual atoms for scaling of quantum computers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technology for parallel, high-fidelity single- and multi-qubit gates in neutral atom quantum computers. The technology will enable neutral atoms as a platform for scalable quantum computing technology with fault-tolerant capabilities.  The proposed project includes: 1) development of systems to control atomic qubits in parallel; 2) a methodology to enact high-fidelity gates; and 3) development of necessary infrastructure for a cloud-accessed quantum computer.  With a previously unrealized degree of coherent control to atomic systems, the proposed system will serve as an entirely novel tool to study many-body physics, enabling new quantum simulations of new phases of matter or high-energy physics.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the ability to enable a safer, more reliable, and more resilient electric power system. A reliable and efficient grid is the cornerstone of the nationâs economy. With the rapid adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), a transition from conventional generation plants to utility-scale wind and solar farms, and the threat of cyber- and/or physical attacks on the bulk electric system, ensuring the reliability and resilience of the grid has become ever more challenging. The software being developed in this project will help grid planning engineers and operators cope with these modern challenges. For the first time, engineers from organizations across the utility industry will be able to collaboratively plan the grid on a secure, scalable, cloud-based software platform that provides the capabilities needed to fully assess the impact of renewables and DERs. The softwareâs industry-leading simulation robustness will allow users to analyze extreme contingencies, cascading events, and weak grid scenarios to develop preventive and corrective actions that secure the grid. The software is designed to support an annual $50B+ in US power infrastructure investment and an annual $400B+ in power market transactions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software for electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) planning.  Technical tasks are to: 1) Make cloud architecture responsive to demand with autoscaling and queueing services; 2) Architect results generation for minimized data storage requirements; 3) Manage data handling for reduced re-loading of datasets; 4) Implement a file parser for industry-standard three-phase unbalanced distribution system models; 5) Implement models of common distribution system components; and 6) Extend the cloud platform to support integrated T&D analysis.  Integration of these optimized components will lead to an improved system engineered for usage at scale.

    Research (SBIR) project is to enable a new paradigm for air pollution monitoring
    and mapping through the U.S. and globally.  According to the World Health Organization,
    4 million deaths per year globally are directly linked to ambient air pollution.
    \ Until now, the approach to monitoring of air pollutants has been limited to
    measurements at a few fixed-base stations spread throughout each U.S. state (e.g.,
    ~30 in Colorado for a population of 6 million), and those stations are purposely
    located far from air pollution hot spots in order to obtain approximate averages.
    \ Recent advances in low-cost sensor technology has enabled new high-resolution
    mapping of air pollutants throughout cities and rural areas through vehicles of
    opportunity, such as those associated with ride share services and delivery vehicles,
    carrying small air quality sensor packages continuously uploading air pollution
    measurements to the web.  The principal roadblock to this approach, addressed
    in this project, is a method to continuously verify the calibration of these mobile
    air quality sensors, inherently less accurate than traditional instruments.  \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop, test and evaluate a distributed calibration
    station, AQSync, to be mounted on lamp and traffic light posts throughout cities
    and towns to provide frequent distributed calibrations of vehicle-borne air quality
    sensor packages.  A major challenge has been the development of relatively low-cost
    miniaturized instruments offering highly accurate measurements for inclusion in
    AQSync.  This is particularly true for black carbon, believed to contribute substantially
    to up to 200,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S. through pollution-related
    health conditions such as asthma, stroke, heart disease and cancer.   The development
    and commercialization of a Black Carbon Photometer in Phase I of this project
    represents a potentially disruptive technology facilitating measurements of black
    carbon directly in the gas phase, without the known artifacts associated with
    previous instruments and within a small footprint suitable for AQSync.  This project
    addresses the next challenge of developing algorithms and demonstrating that implementation
    of distributed AQSync calibration stations enable accurate mobile sensor measurements
    to inform policy-makers, subsequently improving human health.\n\nThis award reflects

By informing water utilities and end-users early on about problems in the drinking water quality or in the distribution infrastructure, the duration of poor tap water quality episodes can be drastically reduced. For the industrial sector, e-CHEM will measure wastewater contamination, allowing its effective treatment and reuse and limiting fresh source water use particularly in regions affected by drought. e-CHEM will have major commercial impact across multiple industries,  minimizing costs, reducing liabilities, and improving health.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to commercialize the e-CHEM analyzer developed and pilot-tested in Phase I to provide a complete data analytics solution for performing water quality monitoring autonomously in critical applications where lack of infrastructure (power, communications), location remoteness, or limited human resources currently impose severe constraints. e-CHEM uses novel reagent-based and reagent-less lab-on-chip sensor technology to continuously quantify multiple water contaminants within a highly-miniaturized instrument, with accuracy and sensitivity levels approaching and even surpassing current laboratory capabilities. This Phase II project will involve a combination of fundamental and applied research aimed at improving the e-CHEM prototype for environmental variations during field operations, optimizing and ruggedizing the system for user operations, and developing machine learning algorithms for data analytics. After full validation of e-CHEM technology for drinking water, the e-CHEM system will also be adapted for harsh environments, such as monitoring of industrial wastewater from unconventional oil-and-gas operations.

    a new paradigm in breast cancer screening with a cost-effective and accessible
    platform for personalized breast health monitoring, empowering women and their
    physicians with accurate and actionable data. In the US, over 300,000 women are
    diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer annually. Breast cancer has
    a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations in cost, sensitivity, and
    accessibility of current screening result in missing 1 in 3 cancers at early stages.
    Early detection is associated with lower costs of treatment that save billions
    of dollars in direct medical care and lost productivity annually, demonstrating
    a clear economic and societal benefit for better breast cancer screening platforms.
    The technology leverages the proven benefits of automated ultrasound and the newfound
    power of cloud-based artificial intelligence to expand the deployment of these
    systems, including lower-resource settings such as walk-in or rural clinics, pharmacies,
    and in the home for self-monitoring. The platform's portability, low cost, 2-minute
    scan time, automated analysis, and patient-centered design greatly increases the
    accessibility and adoption of breast cancer screening, resulting in better clinical
    outcomes and a reduced cost burden to the US healthcare system. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase II project proposes to continue development of a novel platform that combines
    3D automated ultrasound with artificial intelligence (AI) for personalized and
    accessible breast imaging. The proposed project will improve the performance of
    a compact scanner and wearable accessory combination to produce repeatable images
    independent of operator training; this can be accomplished in under 2 minutes
    without expensive capital equipment, ionizing radiation, or patient discomfort.
    The intuitive software will enable physicians to visualize whole breast volume
    and accurately localize and measure lesions. AI will identify abnormal masses
    and predict the probability of malignancy to help physicians with accurate and
    fast diagnosis. The Phase II R&D focuses on five objectives: (i) optimize system
    performance for high-quality whole breast imaging with a new beamforming technique
    for higher resolution, with higher frame rates and faster scan; (ii) finalize
    the wearable and scanner design to ensure reliable operation with water as the
    coupling medium; (iii) conduct usability verification and validation regarding
    safety and functional requirements for clinical use; (iv) conduct a small study
    to verify the scanner's ability in finding existing breast lesions; (v) develop
    a machine learning engine for real-time detection and characterization of lesions
    in images acquired with the ultrasound scanner.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

    Phase II project will be in standardizing attention assessment in elementary school
    children. Teachers currently dedicate too much of their valuable time to tedium.
    The standard school attention assessment calls for a highly trained teacher or
    aide to observe a child for about fifteen minutes and record their attention behavior
    every few seconds. The observer tracks behaviors including out of seat time, audible
    noise, vocalization and so on. Teachers and aides recognize several unappealing
    aspects of this process, e.g., it subjectively depends on the observer, is not
    standardized across observers, and is too time-consuming to provide more than
    an occasional snapshot of the full range of children's attention skills. Worse,
    these difficulties affect the most vulnerable children who may be experiencing
    challenges due to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity
    disorder (ADHD). The time teachers must spend evaluating children's progress limits
    that very progress. The resulting downward spiral for these talented, intelligent,
    and creative young people can be avoided if teachers can focus on teaching, rather
    than the current time-intensive, unstandardized processes.  With the current rise
    in rates of ASD and ADHD in children nationwide, the reliable, simple, repeatable
    attention assessment tool proposed in this project provides important data to
    meet schools' needs by better using teachers' time while generating better outcomes
    for students. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project lies in
    the research and development critical to commercialize an objective attention
    assessment tool that measures sustained attention, distractibility, attention
    orienting, focus, and inhibitory control.  The assessment tool uses eye-tracking
    technology when children play gaze-driven games to allow monitoring of their attention.
    \ Eye trackers use small cameras to measure where an individual's eyes are relative
    to their head. From these data, eye trackers can tell precisely where the person
    is looking on the screen, indicated by a cursor that follows the person's gaze.
    The tool uses this cursor to control video games that were specifically designed
    by researchers at UC San Diego to improve various attention skills. With these
    games, children practice focusing and orienting their vision and learn to ignore
    distractions. The primary goal of this Phase II project is to test a statistically
    relevant sample in the target population of school aged children to validate new
    attention assessment tools compared with existing tedious, expensive, time-consuming
    tools. This research and development links these new attention assessment tools
    to real school outcomes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help usher in a new age of material consumption. While metals have been used for hundreds of years, composites are fairly new but can withstand even more wear and tear than steel. This project is aimed to advance composites even further by making them last longer or shed more weight. This will enable engines to have better fuel efficiency, allow lighter prosthetics, or achieve dependable, durable composite automobile frames. MITO hopes to aid all of these industries with the introduction of competitive and proprietary resin modifying  nanoaddtives that enhance durability and toughness, reduce weight, and can be integrated into common composite manufacturing processes, including infusion molds and pre-pregs. With these potentials, it is estimated that this project could capture roughly 5% of the worldwide additive market currently worth $3.8 billion dollars, positioning material science to solve the composite industry's biggest problems with nano-sized solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale up hybrid nano-fillers based on graphene oxide (GO) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) to kilogram quantities and produce nano-fillers that have reactive moieties that are exactly compatible and dispersible in various resins, which has never been attempted before. The Phase I project successfully met all the technical goals. MITO additives will be added to epoxy or vinyl ester or polyester matrices through a Master Batch process to enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness of composite by more than 70% at extremely low addition levels (~0.1 to 0.2% by weight) without any changes in current manufacturing processes. It is proposed to scale up the existing hybrid nano-fillers, develop novel hybrid nano-fillers with better compatibility with epoxy, vinyl ester and polyester resins by introducing matching reactive groups into the fillers and Master Batching so that interlaminar fracture toughness can be improved by more than 100%. Flexure, Impact and SENB fracture tests, and XRD as well as SEM characterization will be performed on the cured Master Batches and composites. Flexure, double cantilever beam fracture and tension tests will be performed on composite samples to optimize the nanofiller content and the Master Batching process.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the realization of a next-generation soft
    tissue filler. Fillers are used to replenish volumes left by surgical procedures,
    medical disorders, trauma, or aging. In this $6B global market, there is great
    need for a filler having superior longevity to the leading hyaluronic acid products,
    while also exhibiting better safety and reversibility than existing synthetic
    products. This project aims to commercialize a degradable zwitterionic hydrogel
    (DZH) filler formulation that meets these market demands to improve patient outcomes.
    In Phase I, the key features required for an innovative product were identified,
    and prototype DZH formulations achieving these benchmarks were successfully developed.
    The objectives in Phase II are to finalize the design and characterization of
    an initial product, evaluate its in vivo performance in preclinical studies, and
    establish manufacturing feasibility. The success of this project will form the
    basis for a sustainable business, and further enable the development and commercialization
    of many next-generation biomedical products and technologies. \n\nThis project
    will prepare DZH formulations for commercial translation as a reversible dermal
    filler. Currently, all reversible fillers in the skin rejuvenation market are
    based on similar hyaluronic acid hydrogel architectures that disappoint patients
    with their poor longevity. The DZH architecture exhibits a unique set of properties
    that combine to represent a real innovation: these include significantly enhanced
    longevity, high biocompatibility, broadly tunable rheological properties such
    as viscosity and cohesivity, and complete reversibility. The proposed R&D activities
    are designed to bridge the gap between this proof-of-concept and an attractive
    initial product. These include (1) finalizing the formulation and developing analytical
    methods and quality benchmarks prerequisite to in vivo testing and manufacturing;
    (2) scaling the design and protocols for feasible GMP production, (3) performing
    initial biodistribution and excretion experiments in mice; and (4) conducting
    GLP preclinical toxicology studies based on ISO 10993 guidelines. It is anticipated
    these efforts will establish the safest, longest-lasting reversible filler available.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the redefinition of the care of asthma patients. Asthma is highly prevalent in the US, with 25 million patients currently suffering symptoms, and was the cause of 1.7 million emergency room visits in 2015, resulting in a huge societal cost. A predictive platform that can identify when a patient is at risk of an asthma attack would serve to reduce such costs by allowing intervention in a timely manner, thereby reducing the number of emergency room visits by asthma patients. Through the combination of remote monitoring of patient lung function, local environmental sensing, and data analytics, asthma can be understood at a personalized scale, a dramatic shift in the standard of care for this chronic and complex condition. Additionally, the platform developed in this project can be expanded to other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or cystic fibrosis, broadening its impact. Ultimately, it is envisioned that this project will result in a world without asthma attacks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the development of a machine learning-based data analytics platform to identify in advance when asthma patients are at risk of an asthma attack, thereby enabling physicians to alter a patient's care plan and avoid hospitalization. To date, there is no integrated system to gather and analyze high-quality lung function and environmental data for asthma patients on a daily basis in order to truly analyze and predict a patient's health. As a result, asthma care is often reactive, requiring emergency treatment and resulting in poor clinical outcomes. The objectives of this Phase II research include the development and validation of a machine-learning based analytics model to generate new insights into the health of asthma patients; the development and implementation of a physician portal to translate such insights into clinical outcomes; and the development of new datasets to create a more robust and accurate platform. The result will be a live prediction platform to assist physicians in keeping asthma patients out of the emergency room.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids. In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as age-related macular degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to provide a way for Americans to consume more
    lutein and zeaxanthin, which will be achieved by increasing significantly the
    levels of these antioxidants in the U.S.'s most widely grown staple crop: Corn.
    Since corn is used in a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving
    the carotenoid content of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase
    the amount of health benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing
    consumers eating habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically
    feasible, corn varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that also
    are high in grain yield. \n\nThis STTR Phase II project proposes to use genetic
    markers to select for favorable alleles of genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability in corn bred for commercial production. There is considerable genetic
    variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis and stability, however,
    the most favorable alleles are typically not found in varieties that are commercially
    relevant to US corn production. Thus, the use of genetic markers developed previously
    will enable favorable alleles to be moved from lower yielding germplasm that is
    not well adapted to the US Corn Belt into elite inbreds suitable for the production
    of yield-competitive commercial F1 hybrids for the US market. The primary goal
    of this Phase II research is to use the user-friendly genetic markers associated
    with favorable alleles for 18 key genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability developed in Phase I to rapidly develop fixed inbreds for use in
    the production of yield-competitive high carotenoid F1 hybrids suitable for large-scale

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel engineered microbiome as a potential therapeutic for a rare skin disease called Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, severe skin disease with high mortality and few treatment options. This proposal aims to develop a new therapeutic for this disease, a microbe-based protein delivery system of LEKTI, the missing protein responsible for NS symptoms. At the end of this project, a candidate live biotherapeutic product candidate (LETKI-secreting strain of S. epidermidis) will be nominated and the Company will have sufficient data with which to proceed into formal preclinical studies and subsequent human testing. This proposed product will have the potential to address thousands of patients in the U.S., and the broader proof-of-principle of this microbe-based technology offers significant potential to treat millions of patients living with skin conditions. This offers significant advances in innovation in addition to broad commercial potential.

    This project aims to develop a novel therapeutic candidate composed of an engineered strain of S. epidermidis that secretes LEKTI protein to the skin for the treatment of Netherton syndrome (NS). NS is a rare but severe autosomal recessive disease that affects the skin, hair, and immune system. NS is caused by mutations in in the SPINK5 gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor lymphoepithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI), which contains 15 serine protease inhibitory domains. The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept therapeutic for NS: an engineered commensal microbe that delivers discrete domains of LETKI to the skin. The proposed Phase II research plan will establish critical criteria for nominating a potential live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate composed LEKTI-secreting S. epidermidis. This research will perform key activities in preclinical development of an LBP: identify an optimal sequence of LEKTI; develop analytical methods for detecting LEKTI secreted from an engineered strain of S. epidermidis; and develop analytical methods for measuring biodistribution and adsorption of LEKTI secreted by S. epidermidis in a human in vitro model.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project touches upon everything from shower doors to
    consumer electronics to window glass. Deposition of high-quality thin films on
    a large scale with precise energy control can allow, for one example, diamond-like
    carbon (DLC) on glass.  DLC coatings on glass can prevent soapy film build-up
    on shower doors, can improve the scratch resistance of mobile phone displays,

    the use of a greater variety of substrates. In recent years, a number of applications
    have utilized traditional inorganic coatings like silicon oxide on top of new

    conductive oxides on silicon and organic solar cells, and ultra-thin silver. A
    scalable linear ion beam sputter source will establish a high-volume manufacturing
    tool for thin films limited today to much smaller scale. In Phase 1, the source's
    functionality was demonstrated. Phase 2 has two major components: hardware development
    for scale and usability; process development for specific commercial applications.
    The company will deliver a fully integrated control system and a source, scaled
    by 2x and designed for manufacture. Process development will consider beam energetics
    and geometry of beam/target/substrate relative to film and substrate properties.
    For DLC, this will focus on tribological and optical properties. For silver, they
    will test for continuity of ultra-thin films. Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO)
    efforts will focus on electrical properties and substrate impacts, particularly
    carrier lifetime in silicon.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project will create a material, printer, and software
    system for printing a novel set of flexible, durable materials for additive manufacturing
    technologies. Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $7bn
    industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture
    new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing
    economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly
    for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion
    of the available material library. 3D printing materials are limited to a small
    segment of the plastics in common industrial use today. This project will expand
    that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with
    a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant
    for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific
    medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable
    polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from
    low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance
    that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production
    of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material
    printing for novel product designs. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will produce
    a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form
    printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range. The Phase II project
    will also produce an integrated system of printer control software and printhead
    design for production of parts with the polyurethane precursor formulas. The materials
    will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle
    liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the
    starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.
    Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of
    materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce
    a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry,
    and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material
    \ will be parameterized to determine space-filling properties of the material
    as a function of composition, print speed, and printhead geometry.  This 3D printing
    technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that
    are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly
    extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide commercial validation at scale of feedback-based control of arc behavior within the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process.  This will improve VAR performance in the production of specialty metals, resulting in improvements to ingot quality while reducing electricity consumption.  Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry.  Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process. The proposed project is expected to reduce these loses by up to 50% through the application of active, feedback control of the arc dynamics. This type of control is expected to increase yield, decrease energy requirements, and increase safety of the manufacturing process industry-wide.

    This project will result in a system capable of detecting and manipulating the distribution of the arcs utilized during VAR processing. The Phase I effort showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect arc locations on the electrode and influence their movements, using electromagnetic coils, in real time. In Phase II, the arc measurements will be coupled through feedback to control the arc distribution in an industrial-scale research VAR, providing proof of concept at industrial scale. In so doing, the optimal electromagnetic coil geometry, hardware, and materials for driving the arc motion at scale will be identified and constructed. A series of industrial experiments are planned to validate the control system. The chemical composition of the ingots produced during controlled and uncontrolled conditions will be characterized to correlate defects with observed arc behaviors and to identify optimal control parameters.  Similarly, the measured arc distributions will be used to validate the computational solidification modeling, which will be used to identify probable defect regions. The combination of experimental data and validated simulation results will be used to inform the VAR feedback control system regarding optimal arc distribution, yielding an improved control strategy for tailoring the melt process and improving ingot quality.

    Research (SBIR) project are foundations for an emerging industry: insects in agriculture.
    \ Beta Hatch is pioneering the production of new animal feed ingredients, developing
    technology to mass produce insects, and creating STEM jobs. The proposed work
    will allow scaling insects as a sustainable protein-rich feed ingredient. With
    predictable year-round production, this will contribute to a more robust and secure
    agricultural system. The Beta Hatch insect ranch, which will be designed through
    integration of the results from this project, is an on-site solution to convert
    organic by- products into valuable feed ingredients and fertilizer. These ranches
    are being designed as conversions of underutilized spaces (warehouses and poultry
    barns), to bring jobs to rural and HUBZone areas. We work closely with farmers,
    our main customers, to establish the performance and economic value of our products.
    Insects provide nutrition and make animals healthier. Our frass (insect manure),
    is an organic fertilizer that stimulates healthy soils, and has no nitrates (no
    runoff). The proposed work will allow us to establish insects as the world?s most
    sustainable animal feed ingredient, and to disrupt the $400B animal feed market.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to cost effectively scale insect production
    for agricultural markets. Of the millions of insect species that exist, only a
    handful have been successfully reared under controlled conditions and even fewer
    have been mass produced. And yet insects have the potential to fill essential
    roles in agricultural supply chains by biodegrading wastes, removing or recycling
    toxins, and providing nutrition for animals. In order to meet the scale, quality
    and cost requirements for agricultural markets, significant R&D must solve some
    core challenges in insect mass production. We propose to integrate biological
    and engineering approaches to develop novel oviposition substrates, identify and
    mitigate causes of mortality, design automated and flexible diet handling systems,
    optimize rearing trays (the basic unit of production), and maximize yields with
    automated water and diet delivery. The proposed work will cut over 80% of our
    costs, produce several patents, and inform the design of a scalable insect ranching
    facility. As a natural part of animal diets, insects are a predictable protein-rich
    alternative feed ingredient, with year-round controlled production. In Phase 1
    of this project, we established an insect breeding program, explored novel inorganic
    diets, and identified the core production challenges for scaling insects-as-feed.
    For this NSF SBIR Phase 2 project, we develop solutions that will reduce the cost
    of production and control the cost of future facilities.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    is critical for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses
    of materials and will permit imaging in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable
    today. These devices will enable scientists to better image the interplay of structure

    a number of important basic scientific purposes. The devices? primary use will

    class of high-value consumables, addressing a global market segment worth about
    $7 million today with the potential to increase to more than $14 million in the
    near future. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is threefold. First, the
    innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability
    of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very
    thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires
    and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive
    index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled
    layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently,
    polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing
    devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second,
    the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control
    of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third,
    the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material
    layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices
    with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified
    the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete
    fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing
    of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer
    deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices.\n\nThis award reflects

    This SBIR Phase II project, the Engineering Design Instruction Software for implementing Objectives of Next generation standards (EDISON), will combine Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts together with engineering design, simulation, Augmented Reality (AR), 3-D printing, and real-world experiments. The project will create a collaborative platform for middle school engineering projects where students create, analyze, simulate, and construct designs for several types of projects like bridges, cars, circuits, simple machines, drones, and robots. This project will provide positive experiences with STEM and engineering in middle school, when many students lose interest in these economically vital fields. EDISON will foster STEM engagement and inquiry in middle school, by leveraging gaming, team collaboration, 3D printing, and augmented reality. The project will create engineering experiences that connect math and science content directly to real world applications to improve student academic performance in traditional science and math subjects. This work has the potential to promote effective integration of engineering in K-12, prepare students for future careers, expand scientific literacy, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM, supporting NSF's mission.


    This SBIR Phase II project will produce a collaborative engineering design platform for middle school, containing realistic design tools, content creation, embedded standards-based STEM assessment, and tools supporting prototyping and testing. EDISON provides end to end solutions for team-based engineering in middle schools and maintains engagement through gamification. This project will develop sophisticated tools that are lacking in existing engineering curricula, and support math and science standards alignment using model-based engineering, virtual design collaboration, and embedded tools for student evaluation. In this work the Phase I prototype will be extended by developing reusable design modules for circuit design, simple machines, aerodynamics, and programming. Testing tools using sensors and Augmented Reality will be added for real world data collection and analysis. Numerous modular standards aligned lessons and a content creation interface to facilitate EDISON?s transition to an instructional platform will be created. Finally, in collaboration with our University partner EDISON will be extensively tested and student outcomes evaluated in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms using a combination of embedded, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The goal is to better meet the STEM instructional needs of educators and students with superior capabilities, engaging experiences, and easy to use tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to search and understand documents across domains. It is a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to route, categorize and ensure key points of a document are seen. This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can't think of the right keywords.  Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document.  This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
    There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
    will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
    security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
    time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
    spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
    damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
    fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
    inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
    will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
    and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
    and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
    radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
    of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
    moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
    the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
    drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
    maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
    proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
    air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
    state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
    route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
    been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
    in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
    reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
    goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the healthcare needs of the 27 million Americans and 300 million patients globally suffering with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden.

    The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden created
    by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding.  ED crowding
    is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated
    with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently,
    EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients
    visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record
    (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict
    clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing
    the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the
    root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is
    expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient
    progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate
    to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project
    should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting
    the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. \n\n \n\nThe
    proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science,
    decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support
    technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization,
    feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical
    events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes
    a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of
    critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill
    and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge
    (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization
    of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity
    and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The
    proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals
    individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The
    technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to
    consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The
    specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology
    by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance
    monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

    IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    The  broader  impact/commercial  potential  of  this  Small  Business  Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the support of newborn and infant health services at the point-of-care (i.e., in pediatrician offices and at home). This project will develop quantitative imagining and machine learning technology that will allow pediatricians to evaluate and monitor the infantâs head development during well-child visits and/or remotely. If a child is diagnosed with head deformations, early and effective therapy can be initiated. Thus, a major impact of this project is significant reduction of the number of children with cranial deformations who remain untreated and are exposed to potential health risks. Improved clinical management of these conditions will potentially lower the associated healthcare costs and improve patient outcome. Our technology will be packaged as a smartphone or tablet app, enabling access to lower-resourced communities and patients without access to specialized  clinics, as well as enabling care in periods of social distancing and reduced clinical services. This project will ultimately increase awareness of the risks of head deformations and improve pediatric health outcomes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop quantitative imaging and machine learning algorithms that accurately measure the cranial shape and size using photos of the infant head taken with a smartphone. These parameters are commonly used to monitor child development, and in the diagnosis and treatment planning of common conditions with head deformations. In this  project, we will fully automate the measurements using neural networks and maximize accuracy with regression models accounting for endogenous variables, such as sex and age. To generate accurate head shape measurements even during operation by novice users, our new algorithms based on machine learning will automatically select better images to detect and classify the type of cranial deformation. By addressing errors related to novice use of the tool, such as correcting for variations in the use of the camera, the technology will ensure compliance and accessibility to operators with variable technological skills. Furthermore, we will advance reconstruction of the three-dimensional cranial shape utilizing modern smart device technologies. This approach can handle object motion and can be implemented directly on a smartphone/tablet to compute full three-dimensional shape analysis.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports digital pathology. For the past century,
    pathology has been performed on microscopically thin sections of tissues that
    are stained and mounted onto glass microscope slides for analysis by a pathologist.
    This process is labor-intensive, costly, and the turnaround time is typically
    one week. For the vast majority of biopsy procedures, the diagnostic result is
    not obtained for days or even weeks after the procedure. Current bedside pathology
    techniques for rapid diagnosis and quality assurance of biopsy samples are slow,
    inaccurate, destructive to the tissue, and require the presence of multiple trained
    personnel, which prevent them from being widely used. Recent technological advances
    allow digitizing of the physical microscope slides and enable a fully digital
    pathology workflow. However, to date no system can take a fresh tissue sample
    through the entire long, laborious processing lifecycle prior to imaging.  This
    project will develop a tissue processing and imaging platform to enable fast,
    automated processing from the fresh sample to the digital image within minutes
    of tissue removal. This will provide better care and patient outcomes and enables
    new opportunities to provide care in clinical settings with more limited pathology
    resources. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continues
    development of an integrated technology platform that automates the entire process

    automate the acquisition of high-quality microscopic images from samples with
    widely varying surface topographies, while simultaneously improving both speed
    and image quality to meet clinical needs. The new technologies will support parallel,

    multiple samples in a single session. The project will culminate in verification
    and clinical validation of the integrated system.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a set of technologies for the management and care of patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common condition, affecting 1 million Americans, and over 1 in 1,000 live births. It is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain, and nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a tube, known as a shunt, to drain this excess CSF away from the brain and into a distal absorptive site within the body. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates, approaching 100% over 10 years, and diagnosing shunt malfunction is extremely challenging owing to a combination of varied causes, nonspecific symptoms, and the absence of a technology to directly quantify shunt patency. Consequently, shunt-related procedures and admissions significantly burden patients, their caregivers and hospitals, costing the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually. Additionally, the inability to monitor patients at home, coupled with the potential for shunt failure and the uncertainty surrounding its diagnosis disrupts patientsâ quality of life, and frequently results in unnecessary hospital admission and imaging. This project advances a wireless, wearable sensor that can noninvasively measure flow through shunts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a new sensor for shunts. The sensor is based on advances in soft, flexible electronics and relies on measurements of thermal transport to detect flow through underlying skin layers. When placed on skin overlying a shunt, the sensor will measure both the presence and magnitude of flow of CSF, and transmit these data wirelessly to a receiver, such as a smartphone or tablet, where it can be viewed through a software application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project will be specifically aimed at developing the technology for home use and will include features that support long-term measurements, including a rechargeable battery, charging station and cloud data support. The ability to routinely monitor patients with hydrocephalus at home is currently unavailable, and if successful, our sensor will allow for a deeper understanding of CSF hydrodynamics. These data will be used to develop an algorithm to detect long-term trends, with a view to understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing shunt failure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a significant increase to the security of healthcare safe public-private blockchain protocols. The use of blockchain technology drives efficiencies in direct alignment with improved patient experience and improved health, both at a reduced cost. The economic impact of bringing down the costs of providing healthcare has the potential to benefit millions of lives. One serious threat on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is the double-spend attack. With a successful double-spend attack, miners can reverse payments and obscure the audit trail of data access. The deployment of the proposed protocol will ensure the integrity of both these properties. More broadly, the proposed system can improve security for any PoW blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The system can also greatly improve user experience by processing in a timely and standard manner via regularly created blocks.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to virtually remove the threat of double-spends for healthcare safe blockchains. Existing PoW blockchains are based on computational puzzles. Once a miner solves a puzzle, she adds a block to the chain and is rewarded with coins. In expectation, miners produce blocks proportional to their share of the computational resources. But mining is a random process and occasionally a miner with a small share of the resources can generate a majority of the blocks. In those cases, a minority miner can overwrite existing blocks, nullifying or double-spending earlier entries. The proposed system prevents double-spend attacks by requiring miners to aggregate multiple solutions to the PoW problem before submitting a block. This aggregation ensures that miners with the majority of the processing power have a high probability of submitting the majority of the blocks, reducing the risk of double-spends by orders of magnitude. The technical work includes:  First, developing a new consensus mechanism for blockchains. The consensus mechanism is a highly sensitive, embedded piece of software and this adoption will be handled with careful engineering. Second, the project will decrease associated bandwidth use on the network, a primary cost. The project will seek to create a new solution for reducing network costs based on advanced filters. Third, the project will address and mitigate remaining security issues, such as proof withholding attacks and Denial of Service attacks. Finally, the work will empirically quantify the improvements to ensure high quality engineering and to inform translation strategy.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address a major hindrance in developing
    efficient artificial tissues and organs designed to solve multiple health issues.
    Currently, poor oxygen and nutrient delivery at the core of the artificial tissues
    is one of the major causes of graft implantation failure. The public health benefit
    of replacing damaged tissues and organs is at par with curing cancer. Almost every
    part of the human body has been considered a candidate for tissue engineering
    that strives to solve many medical problems such as arthritis, Type I diabetes,

    fastest growing branch of medicine. TERM aims at the replacement or regeneration
    of damaged cells, tissues, or organs with artificial cell replacement devices,
    tissue grafts or organs, to restore normal biological function. However, the dream
    of artificial tissue has not been realized because of the lack of technologies

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a novel Bacterial Intracellular
    Delivery (BacID) platform to deliver therapeutic drugs specifically and directly
    into solid tumor cells, focusing first on the treatment of advanced liver cancer.
    Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths
    worldwide. HCC incidence has tripled since 1975 and increased incidence in Western
    countries is expected due to its link with obesity and diabetes. Almost 75% of
    HCC patients are diagnosed at intermediate or late stages, and no curative treatment
    exists. The current clinical therapies extend overall survival by several months
    before the onset of recurrence or multi-drug resistance, with a cost to the US
    healthcare system of $1.5 B per year. The platform is based on the inherent feature
    of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout the body in ratios of 100,000
    to 1 compared to healthy tissue. This specificity allows the use of proteins with
    a broad toxicity, reducing off-target side effects. The BacID platform can target
    intracellular pathways that are currently undruggable and create new clinical
    therapies for patients that have exhausted all options.\n \nThis Small Business

    for intracellular targets have several obstacles to overcome, such as stability
    in the blood and traversing the cell membrane. The BacID platform has the potential
    to overcome these challenges. This project will create new bacterial strains that
    can be activated for drug delivery. These strains are designed to modulate efficacy
    and drug production for optimal drug delivery. Optimization of growth conditions
    will maximize bacterial fitness and delivery and set the conditions for the development
    of production according to GMP standards. Combined, these advances will result

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of a sensor system for cell-based manufacturing of such products as biologic therapies, food ingredients, and bio-based materials. These sensors will overcome current limitations for tracking critical cell growth data, which requires manual sampling with slow turnaround times.  This system will enable better predictive growth models for improved production process development and will lead to better decision-making on cell type and culture conditions to produce biologic material. Better performance at this stage leads to potentially significant savings during the manufacturing lifetime of the drug.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a wireless sensor system to address the need of continuously monitoring viable cell density during biomanufacturing. Many industries use cells for production, but the initial focus is upstream development of cell therapies and biologics. Central to this development is tracking the growth of cells in a variety of small-scale, single-use bioreactors to determine key event points for feed and harvest. Current methods rely on infrequent sampling and off-line counting due to the volume required, risk of contamination, and cost. The central research objective is to develop methods for standardized sensor and reader fabrication and quality testing for calibration studies in commercially-relevant environments and systems.  The proposed project will develop: 1) sensor stickers that are applied to the exterior of culture vessels, 2) readers that interrogate the sensor, and 3) algorithms to convert the sensor signal to cell count and push notifications to operators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a software application that identifies clinical outcomes to support high validity real-world evidence (RWE). Approaches to ensure data accuracy and protocol validity are critical to maintain safety and efficacy in healthcare.  This project will analyze electronic health data to generate clinically meaningful information for personalized treatment plans for patients with multiple conditions that can confound treatment. This technology will fulfill an unmet need to improve patient outcomes, improve healthcare delivery and chronic disease care management, and reduce healthcare costs for patients. This technology can also improve regulatory and reimbursement decision-making for therapeutic approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the need for consideration of using additional health data to allow for individualized personalized therapeutic plans for patients with multiple co-morbidities. Subgroup analysis or individualized therapy plans for precision medicine are currently not available based upon the structure of randomized controlled trials for broad conditions like breast cancer or hypertension. This proposal seeks to identify clinical outcomes from unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR). The proposed work is to develop analytics using natural language processing and inference to leverage the large amounts of health data from real-world evidence (RWE) and observational studies to augment data provided in randomized controlled trials (RCT). The analytic tools will allow a comparison of the effectiveness of various treatment protocols in defined cohorts of patients and develop a personalized treatment plan for an individual patient with multiple co-morbidities. The tasks include: 1) Leverage linguistic phrases extracted by natural language processing (NLP) to recognize outcome-related clinical findings to be maintained as clinical feature metadata; 2) Combine NLP and inference to accurately identify candidate clinical outcomes; and 3) Apply machine-learned and expert knowledge to accurately define complex outcome measures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to lower costs for injection molding, a common method of manufacturing plastic goods. Unfortunately, injection molding can be a lengthy and wasteful process because molds are designed, machined from metal, and then shipped to an injection molder. The proposed project will develop new tooling for low-volume injection molding applications at strengths and resolutions comparable with machined aluminum at a fraction of the current cost and lead time, providing extra resilience to the supply chain.  This will be used for applications in industries across automotive, aerospace, consumer product goods, and medical devices.

    This Phase II SBIR will apply advancements in 3D printing of fiber-reinforced photopolymers to the injection molding application.  This project will apply advancements in fiber-filled photopolymers (such as ceramic and polymer particle reinforced resins) in combination with magnetically aligned structures to injection mold tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a simple wearable device to manage pain. Despite advances in new therapies, addictive narcotic medications still remain a widely utilized method to control pain for many conditions. The proposed technology represents a new noninvasive approach to blocking nerve conduction without reliance on drugs. The device can be easily adapted to treat any condition wherein pain is transmitted along nerves close to the skin surface. This work will demonstrate feasibility of a novel therapeutic approach to pain management without risk of drug dependence or addiction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will fully develop a human wearable thermal nerve block device for treating severe head and neck pain by blocking nerves in the occipital region. Occipital pain is driven by a number of physiological and pathological causes, and many patients fail to find adequate pain relief solutions that allow them to continue their daily activities, thus leading to poor quality of life with reduced productivity and socialization. The device developed in this project will thermally modulate the occipital region in such a way as to initiate and then maintain a drug-free nerve block.

    Phase II project is to help patients living with diabetes. The disease accounts
    for 12% of deaths in the US and patients face major lifestyle changes.  Most patients
    transition to insulin replacement therapy, which carries a complex dosing schedule
    that, if not followed closely, can leave patients in dangerous states of glucose
    dysregulation. More than 50 million diabetics currently use basal insulin analogs
    designed for longer activity than human insulin. The convenience and improved
    safety of these analogs has led to widespread adoption and a global market surpassing
    $10B. However, all current basal insulins require daily injections, a dosing burden
    that leads to poor treatment adherence, leaving patients vulnerable to dangerous
    fluctuations in blood glucose. The modified insulin described in this Phase II
    project is intended to provide the stability necessary to achieve once-weekly
    dosing. Relaxing the injection schedule should dramatically improve compliance
    and safety for patients; furthermore, the solution can be delivered at lower cost.
    \n\nThe project uses a scalable in vivo protein production platform to produce
    long-acting insulin analogs for the diabetes market. The project utilizes the
    platformâs unique capability to site-specifically install non-standard amino acids
    into proteins, and to produce the modified proteins at scale. By replacing key
    bond-forming amino acids in insulin with non-standard amino acids that form stronger
    bonds, the modified insulins can achieve the stability necessary to support once-weekly
    dosing. The research objectives are to: produce sufficient quantities of variants
    of this insulin analog to support an experimental program, demonstrate improved
    stability of the variants over wild-type insulin in cell-based assays, and demonstrate
    sufficiently prolongated pharmacodynamics of the insulin analogs in an animal
    study to support once-weekly dosing. Potential outcomes include the first insulin
    analog capable of filling a major clinical and commercial need for affordable,
    safe insulin analogs with relaxed dosing schedules. Further, the work provides
    technical validation of a novel protein production platform.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project is an improved treatment for patients suffering from glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting 3.4 million Americans and 80 million people worldwide. The global glaucoma surgery devices market will reach $1.74 billion by 2024, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 20%. In the U.S., glaucoma incurs over $4 billion in medical and societal costs annually. For patients with glaucoma, elevated eye pressure must be lowered to prevent optic nerve damage. However, conventional surgical implant treatments are bulky, highly invasive, and cause chronic discomfort. Newer, smaller devices are less invasive but affect long-term efficacy as they inadequately sustain lower eye pressure when scarring occurs. This project will develop an implant many times thinner than a human hair to safely reduce eye pressure while minimizing patient discomfort and failure from scarring. The device will facilitate patient comfort and surgical ease through a combination of mechanical and materials engineering. Beyond glaucoma, the technology will play a key role in future permanent and efficacious ocular implants - a rapidly growing component of vision care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues development of an ultrathin implant to treat glaucoma. Specifically, this project will optimize a novel corrugated microstructure with a unique combination of mechanical and fluid flow properties. These characteristics provide the implant with stiffness required for handling, flexibility to conform to soft eye tissues, and flow properties for controlling intraocular pressure. Devices will be fabricated using improved micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) methods and validated on a new instrument designed to evaluate flow resistance. This project will conduct biocompatibility, toxicology, and performance studies, monitoring intraocular pressure, levels of inflammation, adverse events, and implant stability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a reduction in the negative effects of laparoscopies, procedures to enter the abdomen through a small incision.  Over 15 million laparoscopies are performed worldwide each year, particularly gynecologists, who represent roughly half the surgeons performing these procedures in the U.S. The proposed procedure does not require surgeons to alter their surgical techniques and requires minimal training. It uses equipment already in the hospital. The benefits will include better surgical outcomes, decreased patient post-op pain, and increased surgeon and patient satisfaction.  Furthermore, it can ultimately be used in other surgical interventions, such as pannus retention, wound management, and liposuction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a less invasive and more reliable method for lifting the abdominal wall during laparoscopic surgery. Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using invasive perforating towel clips. With manual grasp it can be difficult for the surgeon to maintain grip and proper elevation, especially with lean or obese patients. Alternatively, using perforating towel clips is invasive because the towel clips perforate the abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The perforations can be a significant source of post-op discomfort and bruising for the patient. This project focuses on developing a medical device that uses suction to attach to and lift the abdominal wall more reliably than manual grasp and less invasively than perforating towel clips.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help total knee replacement patients who have a joint infection.  Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of a total joint replacement. Beyond immediate treatment, infections can develop years later from unrelated injuries, increasing PJI incidence as older patients opt for replacement joints. Roughly 15.6 million people in the US currently use a replacement joint, and without improved treatment, PJI will represent an estimated $2.2 billion annual US healthcare burden by 2023.  The current standard of care treatment cannot generate sufficiently high antibiotic concentrations within the joint over enough time to eradicate bacterial biofilms on the implant and tissue, the known cause of persistent infection.  This project will advance a proprietary implantable drug delivery system to easily generate and maintain an antibiotic concentration in the joint sufficient to eradicate biofilm and resolve an infection with less surgical trauma, easier patient recovery and lower healthcare cost than the current standard of care provides.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance translation of a novel implantable drug delivery system with an externally worn controller that communicates through skin to a simple implant comprising a pump and reservoir.  When therapy is complete the pump can be left in place with no requirement to remove it, avoiding additional surgery common with current implantable pump technology.   This project advances the development of the implant and controller to generate prototypes for thorough testing, including efficacy evaluation for biofilm eradication within a simulated environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new optical imaging techniques for evaluating the health of skin, teeth and gums. Optical imaging uses light instead of X-rays to produce detailed images of tissues. It has not yet been widely applied for dental and dermatology applications because the light does not penetrate deeply enough into tissues to be useful, and these devices are prohibitively expensive to manufacture. This project will develop a a new imaging scheme that allows deeper penetration into tissues, providing more useful diagnostic information; and with current 3D manufacturing techniques, it could cost roughly ten times less than the current alternatives. This technology will enable new safe, affordable imaging processes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances translation of a novel optical technique, dual axis deep imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT), for clinical imaging of skin and teeth. Translation of OCT is advanced for retinal imaging but has not enjoyed the same success in other applications.  This project will create new instruments for dentistry and dermatology by demonstrating: 1) how dual axis OCT can penetrate more deeply in biological tissues using instruments designed for each application; and 2) the economic feasibility using 3D manufacturing and system design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to identify potential therapies for a multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Newly diagnosed MM is typically sensitive to a variety of therapies, but relapse is common in later stages.  Personalized analysis would improve treatment decisions.  This project will develop new testing for personalized medicine. Although the initial target is MM, this can potentially be applied to other cancers or diseases.  Personalized medicine can lead to reduced healthcare costs, optimized drug development, and improved patient care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help develop methods and techniques that will be used to offer new tests for guiding the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The test relies on resolving changes of cancer cells collected from patients upon exposure to various drug options by measuring the mass of individual cells. Today MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the world. Unfortunately, today there are no biomarkers to define therapeutic susceptibility of MM patients to identify a personalized treatment regimen. This project aims to address this problem by developing a high-throughput single-cell mass measurement platform based on suspended microchannel resonators (SMR) to resolve the effects of the drugs on the cancer cells. In this project a new generation of SMR chips with linked single-cell imaging, image processing and cell classification will be developed to analyze a 20-drug panel in three hours.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is enabling increased throughput and quality in semiconductor, chemical and biochemical manufacturing. The ability to monitor pressure from atmosphere to ultra-high vacuum is a critical need for these industries. This need is currently addressed by using combinations of vacuum monitoring technologies that, in many cases, require the high cost of employing multiple devices for a single job, allowing for multiple failure modes, and increasing the space constraints on the manufacturing equipment.  Errors in accuracy in current systems can lead to lower production yields and failures due to exposure of fragile elements to atmospheric pressure can lead to higher maintenance costs and lower process availability. In this context, this new technology offers a substantial commercial benefit across several large-scale manufacturing industries.  This technology will be further leveraged for other large-scale verticals such as mass spectrometry and radiation detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will exploit ultrasensitive ion-sensing properties of low-power graphene sensors combined with voltage-controlled ion sources and resetting mechanisms for vacuum sensing. The core scientific breakthrough that underpins this technology is an ultrahigh intrinsic charge-to-current amplification mechanism inherently present in the graphene sensors.  This results in measurable changes in electrical conductance caused by the attachment of trace quantities of ions on the sensors. The nonlinear nature of the charge-to-current amplification scales to higher values at lower ion-flux rates, thereby allowing greater effective sensitivity at lower pressures.  In addition, combining these sensors with voltage-tunable ion sources and appropriate resetting mechanisms enables stable, long-term operation over a wide range of operating vacuum pressure.  Manufacturing sensors at the chip scale allows for multi-sensor readout for improved signal and reproducible behavior, along with resilience against failure. Taken together, these technological innovations will allow the development of high-performance vacuum gauges for diverse applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to dramatically improve the corrosion protection of metal assets vital to the energy and transportation industries.  Corrosion contributes to the loss of structural integrity of metal structures, which poses a risk to human safety and the surrounding environment. Metal corrosion costs an estimated $2.5 T globally, with US costs representing roughly 25%.  Durable, anticorrosive, highly water-repellent coatings using special materials can potentially double the lifetime of coatings on oil platforms and ships in a way that protects the environment. This extends maintenance cycles and reduces asset lifetime maintenance costs up to 50%. The high performance will also reduce the number of coating layers, reducing labor costs up to 25% per maintenance cycle.  This technology will improve structural safety, reduce maintenance frequency, lengthen the operating lifetimes, improve environmental characteristics, and reduce the costs of operating and maintaining metal assets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project further translates coatings of superhydrophobic smart particles for high-performance anticorrosion paints.  These superhydrophobic particles offer new on-demand release of corrosion inhibitors (active corrosion protection) and superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) into one multi-functional material, unlike current state of practice. The platform nature of the technology enables inclusion of numerous types of corrosion inhibitors to safeguard delicate marine environments. Smart particles can then be incorporated into many existing coating systems to deliver a unique combination of durable, anticorrosive, and highly water-repellent coatings. This project will optimize production processes and conduct verification and validation tests.

    its antimicrobial properties. These enzymes are highly toxic to bacterial and
    yeast, making them attractive alternatives for chemical preservatives, but creating
    a challenge for manufacturing at scale. This project incorporates a suite of chemical
    and genetic switches to tightly modulate the enzymes' biocidal activity during
    production to allow for high enzyme titers during production in a microbial host
    organism. The research objectives are two-fold: 1) optimize production strains
    and genetics for overexpression of the biocidal enzyme, and 2) optimize downstream

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of low-cost, flexible displays allowing smart objects to better communicate with their users. Researchers estimate that in 2017 there were 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that were not computers, estimated to grow to 125 billion by 2025. These Internet of Things devices are already used in many applications for transportation, health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. These devices can enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety; they will require displays that are thin, low power, flexible or curved, and easy to read. A near-term need is autonomous transportation, which will need a method of visual communication between vehicle and rider.  This project will develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays; just this initial transportation application will help improve mobility for the elderly and disabled, traffic safety, and related needs.  In the longer term, this project will enable manufacturing of improved displays with reduced processing waste.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix (OLED) displays. These displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography, a slow and expensive process. The high-resolution printable anode developed here replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process, laying the foundation for fully roll-to-roll printed displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the incidence of natural gas pipeline failures across the country within the next 3 to 5 years. Every year there are a few hundred 'significant' pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas delivery services. Such events can have severe consequences for a utility including bankruptcy, billions of dollars in liabilities, civil/criminal penalties and higher insurance premiums. This proposed scalable and economical capability to proactively identify potential issues prior to catastrophic failure will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures without requiring additional infrastructure. The project will also help prevent unauthorized third-party activity near pipelines, a leading cause of accidents. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grids, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, temperature, and network characteristics. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur for various reasons, such as sulphur or ice buildup, regulator malfunction, corrosion/aging of hardware, and human error. Such failures are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. Early detection of such signatures with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more) allows corrective action that will avoid loss of life, property damage and service disruption. This project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from real-time pipeline data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties unique to network-level gas-pressure time series. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into failure type, allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations. The project will also develop scalable automated high-dimensional classification models to detect construction activity from satellite and other image data, to initiate preventive action.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is addressing the growing societal need for indoor air purification, as indoor air quality (IAQ) directly affects human health, productivity, cognitive function, and quality-of-life. Awareness of the long-term consequences of poor IAQ has recently witnessed an increase due to research results, improvements in monitoring and sensing technology, public awareness campaigns by organizations such as the American Lung Association, World Health Organization, and Environmental Protection Agency, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding sustainable, economical, and effective solutions to the problem of poor IAQ will greatly benefit public health and wellbeing and will help curtail the spread of pathogens, minimizing the need for social distancing.  This project will develop a new system air purification, addressing viruses, harmful chemicals, odors, and ultrafine particulates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to scale up the production methodology and coating process of novel catalytic materials. The materials are 3D nanostructured porous powders that are designed at multiple length scales to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and longevity, while reducing costs and utilizing raw materials in an environmentally responsible manner. The system uses a synthetic approach based on self-organization of nanoscale building blocks and wet chemistry tools in order to assemble finely structured coatings for integration in air-purification units. This project focuses on expanding it to production scale, wherein achieving control over the composition, structure, porosity, and placement of nanoparticles on a production scale is challenging.  The materials platform development will include adaptation to high-throughput instrumentation and scale-up of the material production and coating process to pilot production. In the process, this project will develop tools and guidelines for manufacturing hierarchically-structured functional materials more generally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is translation of a novel, non-invasive monitor for fetal health during labor and delivery that will improve care and reduce cost. Currently, clinicians rely on monitor technologies that are subjective, unreliable and have high false positive rates for detecting the fetus at risk of hypoxia (fetal distress), resulting in high rates of medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries. When medically unnecessary, intervention by cesarean delivery incurs avoidable healthcare cost, unwarranted maternal risk and adverse consequences for newborns. Further, misdiagnosis of fetal health with current technologies results in costly medical negligence litigation. Fetal pulse oximetry would be applicable to over 3 million births per year in the United States alone.  This project will advance a new technology to measure oxygen in the fetus's pulse, creating a new method to ensure health of mother and child during delivery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a new safe, non-invasive, reflectance-based optical method for transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry. This method detects the fetal signal at the surface of the maternal abdomen and extracts it from the combined maternal-fetal signal. This project will conduct verification and validation tests to integrate signal processing, biophotonics, and pulse oximetry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide new infomration on cognitive health. The support includes 60 M people who identify as athletes, 3 M annually suffering traumatic brain injuries, and the 40 M more looking to measure brain health. Current healthcare assessments are available at specialized facilities with trained professionals and detect only significant changes to cognition. In contrast, this project develops an affordable, reliable way to measure brain health and to monitor changes after treatment, training, and rehabilitation. This project leverages expertise in human performance, cognitive neuroscience, computer science and virtual reality simulation. Furthermore, it offers athletes a way to assess cognitive abilities such as focus, decision making and multitasking.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the technical aspects of training, measuring, analyzing and reporting how people perform athletic and cognitive tasks in unison. These domains of research and technical knowledge come together to form a unique cognition platform that accounts for both physical and cognitive behavior. The platform's measurement instruments reflect cutting-edge research on (1) human perception, specifically in fast-paced and dynamic environments; and (2) the interplay of perception and action in a virtual reality environment. The analytics engine captures and processes thousands of data points per minute describing object locations in simulated space; users' hands, body and head behavior; and cognitive performance.

    proposed injection system offers a less invasive and costly treatment for GERD
    by safely injecting a treatment into the base of the esophagus, reducing healthcare
    costs, improving the quality of life for patients, and potentially reducing the
    incidence of other gastrointestinal diseases. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will
    develop an endoscopic injection system for consistent multiple injections of bulking
    agent into the submucosal tissue plane in the lower esophagus. This technology
    includes a novel system controlling injection depth and directing a needle tip
    to the desired submucosal tissue. This project will optimize the design of the
    needle and associated guidance system for injection of viscous solutions, particularly
    a bulking agent creating submucosal tissue bulging at the lower esophagus and
    ultimately preventing gastroesophageal reflux. This will be the first system to
    use a dual lumen injection needle with the assistance of a saline pilot injection.
    \ The project will further explore the design space of the final manifold housing
    with rapid iterative 3D-printing prototyping.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the improved safety and reduced cost of commercial
    nuclear power.  The annual, global lightweight, high-temperature neutron shield
    market is approximately $100 million. Better materials can increase the safety
    of nuclear plant operations by reducing radiation damage to both in-containment
    components and radiation exposure to power plant workers. This project develops
    a high-temperature, lightweight neutron shield material for reactor design, power

    advantages are the following: 1) it can operate at temperatures 50% higher (degrees
    C) than current materials 2) it is castable, instead of requiring extrusion molding
    or machining and 3) it is cost competitive with current low-temperature neutron
    shielding materials.  The primary objective is to develop a reproducible, full-scale
    manufacturing process for this new material. This new material platform will reduce

    Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will be to supply nitrogen sensors for
    wastewater treatment process control and automation, potentially saving $600 M
    per year in electric energy for the U.S. municipal wastewater treatment industry.
    Municipal wastewater treatment processes are based on energy-intensive aeration.
    Currently, the primary monitoring method is sending âgrab-samplesâ to a lab, with
    delays in receiving results. By enabling real-time process control of the energy-consuming
    denitrification process, electric energy usage can be reduced by 20% or more.
    The economic impact to each municipal wastewater treatment plant is an average
    energy savings of $200 k per year, with less than 6 months payback, and lower
    operating costs while reducing/preventing out-of-control effluent events.  Competing
    technologies for real-time nitrogen sensors are limited by poor performance, high
    maintenance needs, high cost, and reliability problems.  The proposed new sensor
    offers a reliable, cost-effective, low-maintenance alternative with potential
    applications in direct potable reuse (DPR), and managing environmental water quality
    in agricultural fertilizer runoff, industrial discharge and feed-lot monitoring.
    \ The proposed system will help assure the nationâs clean water supply. In addition,
    as a platform technology for use in related fields, future applications include
    industrial sensors for real-time manufacturing process control, homeland security
    sensing for chemical and biological defense, and biomedical use for point-of-care
    diagnostics.\n \nThis STTR Phase II project proposes to develop an infrared-detection
    sensor for real-time monitoring of nitrogen as nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia in
    municipal wastewater. The  technology addresses strong IR attenuation in water
    with the first industrial-scale sensor application based on a fiber-optic evanescent
    wave technique, guiding mid-IR radiation from a tunable quantum-cascade laser
    through an IR waveguide rather than through the wastewater itself. The incorporation
    of an ion-exchange material as an encapsulating medium reduces interference and
    acts as protection against fouling.   Novel control algorithms for auto-calibration
    enable long-term autonomous operation and ensure a reliable signal-to-noise ratio,
    for 24x7 real-time control of the energy-intensive aeration process. The proposed
    nitrogen sensor will have a wide range of sensitivity, from 0.1 ppm to 250 ppm,
    and can be used for other important chemical species with fingerprints in the
    mid-IR spectral range, such as phosphorus and organic contaminants, making it
    a robust tool for water quality assessment.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the improvement of high-power devices that will enhance the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs) and their charging stations. The development of the proposed high-power devices will potentially reduce EV charging time to less than 10 minutes by increasing the charging module's power from 300 kW to over 1 MW.  Furthermore, this technology can potentially increase the range of electric vehicles significantly by increasing efficiency, and miniaturizing power modules by eliminating cooling systems.  These systems are based on diamonds, which have special properties when used in advanced devices, and will be easily extended to applications requiring high-temperature operation (above 300 C) and high-power switching capabilities, such as geothermal drilling, aerospace, and power grids, as well as application in extreme environments and space exploration.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will fabricate next generation semiconductor high-power diodes (1200 V blocking and 10 A forward current at less than 10 V) that are reliable at high temperatures (300 C) and overcome many of the challenges with existing technologies. Diamond has a higher breakdown field than other existing semiconductor (wide bandgap) materials; thus, diamond devices offer the potential of higher blocking voltage. Technical objectives of this project include optimizing the workflow of material deposition, device design and device fabrication processes to achieve 1200 V blocking voltage by developing device designs that increase breakdown field by 2-4 times to enable broad translation of this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance the development of a self-cleaning window glass coating with the same appearance as bare glass. The improved performance and decreased cost will enable its use in applications beyond residential and commercial windows, such as outdoor displays and solar modules, dramatically increasing the potential overall market opportunity.  More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve many properties of surfaces used in wide-ranging applications from computer chips to clothing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a high-performance photocatalytic self-cleaning coating on glass. Present photocatalytic coatings typically utilize dense titanium dioxide, that increases the reflectance of the glass because of its high refractive index.  Initial work has demonstrated coatings of controllable refractive index deposited with a new coating technology, Aerosol Impact-Driven Assembly (AIDA).  This project will scale a multilayered, multicomponent coating that addresses the photocatalytic activity/transmittance trade-off. The coating will have industry-leading photocatalytic activity and transmittance higher than the current state-of-the-art at lower costs. More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve the optical, thermal, electronic, chemical, and adhesive properties of surfaces for many applications.  Research objectives include optimization of the durability and outdoor performance of this coating by refining the deposition hardware and the coating structure, demonstration of the scalability of the AIDA process by depositing coatings on larger substrates, and quantification of the performance metrics required for infusion.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a platform technology for discovering
    molecular glues. Many illnesses, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and neurological
    diseases, can be treated by controlling the activity or abundance of specific
    proteins in the cell. However, many proteins cannot be targeted by traditional
    drugs. Instead, pharmaceutical companies are now using a new strategy to hijack
    the cellâs native quality control pathways and degrade proteins to control their

    therapeutic strategy, but significant challenges remain for discovering molecular
    glues. The proposed platform for molecular glue discovery is expected to have
    a major commercial and societal impact by conducting high-throughput screening.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
    advance the development of a novel platform for discovering molecular glues, or
    drugs that function by agonizing protein-protein interactions. This platform combines
    the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique
    by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed
    on the cells' surfaces. Initial results demonstrate that next generation sequencing
    of diploid cells can be used to simultaneously measure the affinity of many protein-protein
    interactions with high accuracy and correctly determine the effect of well-characterized
    small molecules that inhibit or enhance particular protein-protein interactions.
    Additionally, the platform is functional in a 96-well plate format, which is important

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project proposes continued development of a directional microwave ablation (MWA) system. During MWA, doctors use image guidance to insert a thin needle-like applicator into a target tumor and then energize the microwave antenna embedded in the applicatorâs tip to heat and kill the tumor. MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner.

    As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter (<2.0 mm) applicator suitable for minimally invasive treatments is technically challenging and requires the use of novel design methods, fabrication processes, and materials. Technical work in this Phase II projects includes: 1) Industrialized design of the prototype ablation applicator and transmission cable hub, and associated fabrication and assembly process development to improve quality and clinical usability;  2) Testing and characterization of clinical delivery parameters, and developing an algorithm that informs treatment planning for the creation of customizable treatment zones;  3) Development of a programmable multi-channel MW generator platform, affording customizable control of energy delivery parameters, and 4) Detailed system integration and in vivo system performance assessment and characterization to develop treatment planning and dosing guidelines. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and in vivo experiments in porcine liver and kidney to design, optimize, and validate our applicators and integrated microwave ablation system. The goal of this R&D effort is to complete the technical design of a clinically viable directional microwave ablation system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop technology that will improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in combatting the U.S. illegal drug epidemic, which contributed to over 67,000 drug overdose deaths in 2018. An affordable, effective field drug test system, superior to conventional color test kits and Raman-based test systems, would address this challenge, particularly because the widely used color test kits are outdated, hazardous, and susceptible to a high false positive rate. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit data analysis that will help LE reduce the supply of dangerous drugs from the communities they serve. This innovation has the potential to expand into other markets, including medical diagnostics and environmental analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will implement a novel system for on-site presumptive drug testing and collection of drug intelligence for LE. Conventional color tests are inaccurate and highly flawed, often resulting in failure to accurately detect common drugs and novel drug analogues as they are introduced into the illegal substance market. Commercially available handheld devices that utilize Raman spectroscopy are superior to color test but are too expensive for local and state LE agencies to widely adopt. The research objectives involve further developing a system that leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in a low-cost handheld spectrometer, a sampling device that uses a drug-indicating chemosensor, and software that consists of a mobile app and cloud-based technology to help identify illegal substances and specific drug signatures. The anticipated technical results will be the optimization of the handheld spectrometer design and drug-sampling device, identification of new photoluminescent chemosensors for controlled substances, and software to enhance the accuracy of the sample data analysis.  This system will establish tools for forensic analysis of drug signatures and regional trends in illegal drug trafficking.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a high-resolution digital fingertip: a soft, easy-to-use, and compact sensor that will provide human-like tactile sensing. Such a sensor can be used to automate assembly tasks in next-generation factories, enable smart objects to understand their tactile environment, and equip scientists with a finger-like sensor for studying human touch. Industries have been transformed by the digitization of our auditory and visual worlds. A high-resolution digital fingertip will provide the mechanism for digitizing the tactile world, leading to applications and technological developments that will affect many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a soft, compact, and high-resolution tactile sensor based on elastomeric imaging technology. To achieve the desired form factor while maintaining a large sensing area, this project will develop novel optical and illumination configurations more compact than designs using conventional optics. These developments will demonstrate micro-scale imaging by a compact device and allow for modularity to expand the sensing area. This effort will lead to new insight into illumination design for shading-based 3D measurement, as well as optimizations to allow for real-time tactile information. The system will be coupled with a software development kit that provides real-time tactile information, including contact locations, force, and shape. The software development kit will make the system accessible to researchers and engineers from other disciplines, essential for broad adoption.  The high-resolution digital fingertip, together with the software development kit, will enable new applications benefiting from tactile information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the replacement of steel with synthetic materials that are stronger and lighter. The beachhead market for this technology is the performance bicycle spoke market, which is a $180M global market. The potential benefits of this technology go beyond cycling because the polymer-to-metal interface has other potential applications. Cable assemblies are used in a wide variety of applications and industries such as industrial, aerospace, construction, and consumer goods. Advances in the termination of synthetic cable assemblies will enable the creation of higher strength-to-weight ratio cables and thereby increase efficiencies in transportation applications and improve the safety of tension based systems. An application of particular societal benefit is wheelchair wheels, where weight reduction increases portability for those with physical disabilities. Investment in termination technologies for high performance polymers will also help bridge the gap between polymer research and industry, helping society benefit from developments in polymer science occurring in academia. Finally, the ability to produce low-cost rope terminations will increase US manufacturing competitiveness because the majority of high-volume production is outsourced to low-cost labor markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced manufacturing process for ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and metal hybrid structures for bicycle spokes. UHMWPE has a strength-to-weight ratio of fifteen times that of steel, but it cannot be utilized in many applications because of the difficulty in manufacturing high-strength bonds to metal. The primary objectives of this research are to automate the insertion and bonding of stainless steel rods inside the hollow cavity of braided fibers, and to automate the creation of eye splices. These operations require delicate manipulation of fibers in a confined space, and are typically performed manually. Instead, we will develop novel automatic machinery that will create these bonds, inspect the final product, and validate the strength with 100% in-process inspection. Another objective of this research is to develop a black surface coating process for braided UHMWPE fibers. To achieve this, we will identify a surface pretreatment procedure to add functionality to the non-polar backbone of UHMWPE, develop the coating chemistry, and create an in-line coating system that integrates with our manufacturing process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a novel waterless rock fracturing technology that can replace hydraulic fracturing in the future.  Hydraulic fracturing requires pumping of millions of gallons of water into a reservoir to create permeable pathways within the rock, and increase hydrocarbon recovery rates. However, hydraulic fracturing technology has been banned in some regions within the United States, and in various countries across the globe due to water scarcity and environmental concerns. This has left trillions of dollars in petroleum resources trapped within the earth, negatively impacting the global economy. The waterless fracturing technology being developed under this project utilizes pulsed electrical energy to fracture rocks instead of water, allowing for hydrocarbons to be recovered with minimum environmental impact. The research conducted during this project will provide further insights into the advantages of utilizing electricity to fracture petroleum reservoirs and assist in accelerating successful commercialization of the technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel electric reservoir stimulation method to increase reservoir permeability without requiring pumping of hazardous material into the subsurface. This project will advance the development of an electric stimulation method by testing it on rock samples under higher pressure and temperature conditions, to mimic the downhole conditions of several common petroleum reservoirs and allow for optimization. This project will also include the design of a downhole tool that will be utilized to carry electrical current from the surface to the target reservoir for field demonstrations of the technology.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project focuses on improving the management of chronic disease by enabling team-based primary care is key to achieving clinical results and taking advantage of new âvalue based" payment reforms. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, six out of ten adults have a chronic disease and 90% of the national annual healthcare expenditures are spend on people with these conditions.  Our technology proposes to apply precision-education instructional theory to enhance primary care team competencies and promote situational awareness, enhanced communication, defined role clarity, improved coordination and leadership support to improve patient outcomes which is directly aligned to the National Science Foundationâs mission of promoting science to advance the nationâs health.  This project is being designed for commercial use in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which serve one in twelve people in the United States.  There are 1,373 FQHCs in the US serving 27 million patients annually in medically underserved areas. Public and private payment models are rapidly moving toward incentives/bonuses for team-based care and demonstrated outcome improvements. Improvements in the cost and outcomes of care for this patients with chronic disease will have enormous social and economic benefit for the Nation.

    This SBIR Phase II project uses machine learning to integrate individual-level clinical and social characteristics into suggested treatment paths and to apply precision training techniques that improve the skills of individual members of the care team. Our objectives focus on validating the feasibility of machine learning to provide health professionals with recommended workflows and continued education based on trends and gaps in care identified from patient data. The method includes a computational engine to guide reinforcement learning. Machine learning has made possible the development of statistical models to establish effect sizes of clinical interventions, enabling personalized instruction and support to health team members based on patient outcomes.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project would be the ability to deploy drones in industrial
    and commercial indoor environments as aerial robots.  A key requirement to deploying
    drones in such indoor environments in the presence of people is to make them safe
    and non-threatening.  In addition, for drones to function as robots, they need
    to be made fully autonomous and minimize the need for human operation or intervention.
    \ These attributes are not possible with conventional drone technology today.
    \ The ability to use drones as aerial robots can open opportunities in applications,
    such as warehouse inventory scanning, construction, security, and factory automation.
    \ Such robots can enable functions such as scanning and reconstruction of the
    environment, or also âpick and placeâ at high throughput within factories.  The
    use of drones in industrial indoor environments for these applications can also
    result in broader societal benefits, including improved worker safety inside industrial
    indoor environments (by performing tasks that may otherwise require harnesses,
    forklifts or ladders); reduced environmental impacts (in construction sites by
    catching discrepancies early and minimizing rework and material wastage), and
    larger benefits (enabling automated factories of the future). \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project has the potential to advance the frontiers
    of knowledge in design and control systems for use in drones and other applications.
    \ Drones face challenges relating to efficiency, noise and safety.  This research
    addresses design and control systems for rotorcraft and enables improved performance,
    broadening the range of applications.  This research project will be focused on
    the design and modeling of the system, development of the control mechanisms for
    the system, and integration, test and demonstration to advance legacy technologies
    hitherto deployed in rotorcraft.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to make on-site hydrogen generation convenient and economically viable. Hydrogen is a chemical used widely in industry and serves an alternative fuel source for electric vehicles, increasing drive range and shortening refueling time, but adoption has been limited by the needs for refueling infrastructure.  One method to address this is to create hydrogen by splitting water, alleviating the safety, logistical, and reliability issues associated with the delivery and storage of hydrogen, but existing technology has been associated with high capital and operating costs. The objective of this proposal is to advance water splitting technology, enabling a non-polluting, zero-emission hydrogen solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced electrolyzer.  The project will (1) synthesize the catalysts and fabricate these electrodes on an industrial scale; (2) characterize the relationship between electrode architecture and kinetic and mass-transfer limitations; and (3) identify the electrode architecture, stack compression, and flow rates required to translate the performance of these electrodes to an industrial-sized prototype.  The project will utilize mathematical modeling to guide electrode architecture development and a three cell industrial-sized test stack for experimental testing before employing electrodes in a full 4 kg/day stack. Furthermore, the project will employ the electrodes in a 4 kg/day pressurized stack and integrate these components to produce hydrogen at 20 bar to the SAE J2719 standard of 99.998% purity.  The projected targets for stack and system efficiency for the final system are 43 kWh/kg and 55 kWh/kg.

    This broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop low-cost, biodegradable biopolymers to replace non-degradable, single-use plastics to reduce plastic waste.  Currently, most plastic products are made from non-renewable resources and are not degradable in nature. In agriculture and horticulture, there is a need for low-cost, biodegradable and compostable plastics to support the production of food and other agricultural products. More broadly, in other industries, like consumer packaged goods and food-service packaging, there is a growing demand for biodegradable and compostable products. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability for biopolymers made from lignin, the primary waste product of the paper and biofuel industries. These biopolymers will have mechanical properties comparable to commercial plastics; they will be biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and in industrial composting conditions in under 6 months. At the end of this project, multiple grades of biopolymers will be identified and optimized for applications, such as nursery containers for greenhouses or agricultural mulch film for farmers. The scope of this project will also include the exploration of novel manufacturing processes that will address product applications beyond agriculture and horticulture.

    The proposed SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a new family of biodegradable plastic materials using lignin, an organic waste product from the paper and biofuel industries, as a key low-cost input material treated as a copolymer, rather than a reinforcing filler, such as carbon black. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability of a novel reactive extrusion technology, capable of producing biodegradable and compostable thermoplastics with lignin contents of at least 50 weight percent, using solvent-free reactive processing. The polymer alloys will have mechanical properties comparable to commodity polymers, such as low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and thermophilic composting conditions in under 6 months. These materials will be validated for commercial scale production using twin-screw extruders, converted to raw material feedstocks used in plastics manufacturing including filament, pellets, and sheet, and then converted with standard equipment into products such as containers for agriculture, floral, and forestry plant production.

    Phase II project is to provide commercially-deployable technology for highly-scalable,

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals as well as enable large scale field monitoring and management in production agriculture.  The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to establish autonomous data collection under-canopy from field crops using a low-cost ground robot. The proposed work will enhance the ability to collect data autonomously in full-scale crop-breeding fields throughout the season and enable on-site data analytics for remote sites with limited connectivity. Long-term field adaptive autonomy will be achieved through implementation of multiple low-cost sensors. Robot's real-time control algorithms will be developed to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under-canopy field environments. Finally, the research will develop hardware specific edge-compute versions of the analytics algorithms to enable on-site data analysis. These innovations will together enable global deployment of the system for effective data collection and phenotyping.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help semiconductor chipmakers overcome
    manufacturing challenges in Chemical Mechanical Planarization/Polishing (CMP)
    processes.  CMP processes enable cutting-edge manufacturing; currently chipmakers
    often face scaling difficulties as the size of the smallest features continues
    to decrease, increasing the impact of CMP imperfections and resulting in higher
    defect rates. The proposed polishing process enables chip fabricators to reduce
    these CMP imperfections by 50% and improve performance, while reducing costs and
    increasing process throughput.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project will improve CMP processes with innovative polishing pads. Conventional
    polishing pads have randomly distributed micropores inside of the pads and typically
    generate around 1% real contact area between the pad asperities and wafer during
    polishing. This leads to unwanted polishing results, such as dishing/erosion and
    scratch defects on chip patterns due to the stress concentration on asperities.
    Conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to regenerate the asperities
    on the pad surface. The polishing processes developed under this project use microfabrication
    technologies to control micro-features on the pad surface. Therefore, the contact
    area between the pad and wafer is customizable and controllable up to 30%. This
    will improve the polishing performance precision and consistency, leading to fewer
    defects. As the micro-features on the soft sub-pad are independent, the conformity
    of the pad increases and the pressure on the wafer is evenly distributed across
    the wafer surface. This will significantly improve the chip-level planarization
    and wafer-level uniformity, and reduce the pad wear.  As a result, the pad conditioning
    process can be minimized or even eliminated from the CMP process.\n\nThis award

The macrocyclic ligands will be modified to further increase T1 relaxivity of the Fe(III) complexes. The hydrophicility of the complexes will be increased to better mimic the clearance profiles of Gd(III) based agents. Scale-up of the synthetic procedures will produce sufficient compound batches for toxicity studies in mice, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the no adverse effect level (NOAEL), imaging studies in rats, as well as histology and metabolic panels.  The most promising complexes will be subjected to further toxicity studies including Ames testing, thymidine kinase cell screens and cardiotoxicity assays.

- abstractText: "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project is an imaging system with complete flexibility in focus and zoom
    while keeping the sample and all optical lenses stationary. The system will alter
    magnification without mechanical motion, allowing inspection of samples during
    manufacturing processes with 100x faster focus and zoom. The attachment will easily
    integrate with benchtop microscopes for failure analysis, quality assurance in
    manufacturing, electrophysiology, and cryogenic applications; these solutions
    can be used in the food, petroleum, and pharmaceutical industries, among others.
    \n\nThe proposed SBIR Phase II project will develop fast, small- and large-diameter
    MEMS mirrors and demonstrate them in a zoom and focus system made for microscopy.
    Gross electronic focus control capability has only recently become available,
    enabling the development of new standard optical design practices to best utilize
    varifocus elements and characterize imaging performance, since traditional optical
    analyses assume fixed focal length lenses or mirrors. The proposed technology
    has potential applications in cameras, wide-field, confocal and two-photon microscopes,
    optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic imaging systems. In this project,
    a series of MEMS mirrors in combination with standard optics capable of rapid
    2x zoom with additional focusing abilities will be developed, enabling a typical
    20x optical microscopy to rapidly zoom to 40x.  The technical objectives are:
    1) improve fabrication and packaging processes on MEMS mirrors; 2) automate characterization
    of their focusing range and dynamic behavior; 3) design a small form factor, large
    bandwidth, high-voltage amplifier; and 4) characterize the imaging performance

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to address two common conditions in the aging population, presbyopia and cataract, with a single device. Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye to adjust focus, is expected to affect an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide by 2020. Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision and the leading cause of blindness in the world, is expected to affect an estimated 30 million Americans by 2020.  Currently no single product restores both visual clarity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract surgery.  The proposed device will change the standard of care for cataract surgery, leading to improved outcomes.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an intraocular lens using a new, highly sensitive optical system that leverages large differences in refractive indices and has a novel mechanism of action, potentially leading to levels of accommodation on par with the abilities of a young, pre-presbyopic individual. Prospective technologies may fail to exhibit adequate accommodative amplitude to restore a full range of vision, produce unwanted visual artifacts, or are too complex for adoption at scale. Using highly sensitive optics, the proposed device mimics the shape of the natural lens while still maintaining relative simplicity, allowing for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye to produce significant accommodation and permitting the use of standard cataract surgical procedures.  This technical tasks associated with the new intraocular lens include: (1) assuring visual quality through the deviceâs accommodative range, (2) optimizing mechanics for restoration of a complete range of vision, (3) integrating seamlessly with existing surgical procedures, and (4) testing implant longevity and safety.  Validating the objectives above through optical and mechanical testing in benchtop, cadaver, and animal models will provide a strong foundation for clinical investigations and translation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the enablement of next generation manufacturing technologies for semiconductor devices. The deployment of novel semiconductor devices such as 3D NAND, the latest device architecture developed for flash memory, is often stymied by the development of nanomanufacturing processes. The objective of this proposal is to build upon a recipe prediction platform to create a standalone software solution for semiconductor equipment and chip manufacturers to rapidly optimize their processes.  In this research, the software speed will be increased, prediction capabilities will be extended to 3D structures, and model calibration will be automated to facilitate customer deployment. By accelerating the development of the processes used in device fabrication, this project reduces the cost of recipe development in the semiconductor industry and bringing next-generation technologies to fruition.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new advanced physical and statistical models to quickly and accurately predict outcomes for processes like plasma etch and deposition. In this research, 2D and 3D profile simulations will be algorithmically optimized for speed to give process engineers instantaneous results. Machine learning models will be used to enable process engineers to rapidly explore complex trade spaces. Sophisticated numerical algorithms will be developed to help engineers maximize process windows.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will advance the development of a device to eliminate complications associated with maintenance hemodialysis, a life-sustaining therapy for patients suffering from renal failure.  Hemodialysis (HD) enables blood to be withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of the failed kidneys. This process must be repeated at regular intervals and thus requires repeated, high flow access to circulating blood. Adverse events due to mode of access and device failure are frequent, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars per year and leading to significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Currently, no technology on the market addresses dialysis graft needle injury or graft material degradation due to needle trauma.  The proposed device will minimize injury levels and decrease the probability of serious complications for chronic HD patients.

    The proposed Phase II SBIR project will advance a technology for prosthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) for hemodialysis.  The general principle is to engineer a graft with a backplate material optimized for rigidity to prevent needle injury, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to maximize optimal flow.  The technical objectives include: 1) systems engineering to optimize the cost and performance trade space; 2) advanced biocompatibility testing; 3) design verification and validation testing.

    Currently, there is no cure for glaucoma, but early can often save oneâs vision.
    Eye pressure is the most commonly used measure for predicting and monitoring glaucoma.
    The wearable technology developed under this SBIR project will monitor eye pressure

    pressure measurements, informing providers and improving compliance associated

    which wearable eyeglass frames are used to track intraocular pressure (IOP) by
    imaging the level of pressure-induced mechanical strain associated with the tissue
    at the front of the eye - specifically, exposed sclera.  IOP is, by far, the most

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a high-performance, economic, and sustainable carbon fiber material and associated processing technology for consumer electronics, aircraft interiors, and mass market automobiles. In current processes, roughly 30% of carbon fiber is typically scrapped during manufacturing. By 2024, an estimated 50,000 metric tons of virgin carbon fiber will be scrapped and disposed in landfills. The proposed technology will extract value from scrapped fiber and prevent disposal, offering up to 25% cost reduction compared with carbon fiber products commercially available today. This technology creates higher usage and new opportunities for this advanced material.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-performance composite that utilizes low-cost and sustainable milled carbon fiber.  An industrial roll-to-roll production process will be used to compound virgin carbon fiber with milled fiber.  These reclaimed fibers are oriented in the Z-axis using a proprietary technology adapted from an industrial process originally developed to make thermoset products.  The proposed project will develop a market-ready thermoplastic product with dense Z-axis reinforcement while retaining key in-plane properties. This new thermoplastic product will be targeted towards translation to high-volume consumer electronics, aircraft interiors, and automotive applications.

    allows stereoselective large-scale economic synthesis of various complex polypropionate
    building blocks from simple starting materials, allowing large-scale production
    without tedious/expensive purifications and using industrial-friendly crystallization
    instead. The platform allows easy monitoring of reaction progress, enables smooth
    process production, and avoids using the cost prohibitive chiral auxiliaries.
    This project will expand on previous work demonstrating one set of enantiopure
    polypropionate polyketide natural products (PPNP) precursors for broad applications;
    these precursors were used to design and synthesize potential lead compounds for
    anti-microbial crop protection applications. In the proposed work, we will expand

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable a new display technology that, among other benefits, reduces the power consumption associated with public displays, TVs, mobile devices, wearables. MicroLED display technology has the potential to reduce display power consumption by 90% relative to today's displays, representing a large opportunity to impact the world's power consumption profile.

    The proposed project will advance the Laser Enabled Advanced Placement (LEAP) technology to a level where microLED displays can be produced efficiently, reliably, and in volume. MicroLED displays are widely considered to be the next generation of display technology, but the lack of methods for placing the millions of required microLEDs per display is one of the major obstacles to their commercialization. LEAP solves this problem by rapidly scanning a laser beam diffracted into multiple beamlets across the source wafer to transfer microLED arrays in rapid succession, achieving placement rates orders of magnitude higher than current methods. The tasks in this project include the development and optimization of the entire LEAP process, including the development of critical-to-the-process materials, preparation of microLEDs for transfer, laser placement of microLEDs, and microLED interconnection on the device substrate. The goal is to demonstrate a placement rate in excess of 100 M units per hour with a placement precision of <10 microns (3-sigma) and a yield of >99.5%. The project will conclude with a demonstration of a microLED display assembled with the newly developed processes.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is establishment of sustainable, cost-effective technology
    to mitigate volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in a variety of industrial settings
    by using photocatalysts to effectively destroy them. The technology is broadly
    applicable to VOC removal and is highly relevant to environments with low levels
    of VOCs that pose health, environmental, and manufacturing risks and where current
    approaches underperform. The proposed innovation addresses key gaps limiting the
    successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically the
    need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the implementation
    of high-performing photoreactors employing robust photocatalysts with long lifetimes.
    It is expected that the developed technology will extend to chemical processing
    on an industrial scale, including CO2 conversion. This technology will enable
    large-scale processes and has the potential for an extensive societal impact by
    reducing CO2 emissions that affect climate change. The technology will also form
    the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential products, which
    will improve indoor air quality in homes and businesses where VOCs pose health
    risks. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve indoor air quality in
    industrial settings by developing a photocatalytic technology platform that enables
    efficient and effective VOC removal. The technology will be particularly valuable
    in the presence of low-level contamination where alternative technologies are
    expensive, poorly performing, and adversely affect the environment. Photocatalysts
    are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants. When activated
    by light, their surfaces become chemically active via formation of reactive oxygen
    species, which decompose toxic VOCs. The objectives of this project are to overcome
    the key drawbacks of commercially available photocatalysts that inhibit their
    widespread use in industrial environments. Previous photocatalysts form by-products
    and intermediates, which may be toxic or which can contaminate the photocatalyst.
    Those products are powder-based, leading to shedding and high attrition. The proposed
    research will develop a photocatalyst and photoreactor systems that provide efficient
    light coupling and enable rapid reaction rates. The anticipated result is a highly
    robust photocatalyst with an optimized macroscopic form factor that is matched
    to a prototype reactor system. The technology developed in Phase II will be validated
    for industrial VOC mitigation in the parts per trillion range.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will provide a next-generation commercial
    method of removing volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) such as benzene, formaldehyde
    and methylene chloride from indoor air.  These compounds are potential carcinogens
    and also exacerbate allergies, asthma, and other respiratory problems.  Indoor
    air quality is generally 5 times worse than outdoor air quality, and VOCs are
    prevalent indoors because they are emitted from carpets, adhesives, plastic products,
    typical household chemical cleaners and electronics. Children are especially sensitive
    to VOCs, and indoor environments pose greater health risks because of the time
    spent indoors. Alleviating the daily discomfort and financial burdens, estimated
    at around $50 billion annually in the U.S., posed by environmental air pollutants
    such as VOCs can significantly improve human health and comfort.  The development
    and commercial deployment of this new technology will also provide enhanced scientific
    understanding of manufacturing for nanotechnologies. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on validating the ability of a biosilica-based
    photocatalyst to actively and continuously improve indoor air quality by reducing
    total VOCs found in indoor environments when the photocatalyst is added to floor
    and carpet coatings. VOCs are emitted as gases from certain solids and liquids,
    and they include chemicals potentially causing short- and long-term adverse health

    validate manufacturing processes to achieve scale-up quantities needed for commercial
    production. The technology works by first adsorbing VOCs and then degrading them
    to CO2 and H2O. Coated surfaces in test chambers simulating a typical indoor environment
    will be evaluated via continuous monitoring of airborne pollutants. It is anticipated
    that the ultimate deliverables of this project would include validation of a VOC-degrading

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is addressing the critical societal need to remediate toxic organic pollutants in soils and sediments. The proposed technology would enable environmental goals to be met on many contaminated sites whose remediation is currently limited by high costs. The technology would contribute to the re-development of many billions of dollars in real estate by returning properties to productive and appropriate use. The hybrid bacterial augmentation and thermal technology provides a model for additional systems with other bacteria uniquely suited to applications in emerging contaminants and water treatment.

    This project proposes to commercialize a bacterial treatment for the degradation of organic contaminants of concern in environmental matrices such as soils and sediments. The thermally-enhanced bioaugmentation technology evaluated in Phase I is based on a novel bacterial strain and its enzymes that function at elevated temperatures and are capable of degrading a variety of ring based, organic pollutants, including chlorinated forms difficult to remediate. Pilot tests on soils contaminated with Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) demonstrated degradation for both TPH and for the heavier poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PaHs) on the EPA's list of priority pollutants. Phase II goals are to expand these initial studies to the full commercial scale of 100s to 1000s of tons of soil by working with established environmental engineering firms with extensive experience in thermal treatments of large volumes. To fully commercialize this new technology, the production capacity for the biological agents also will be scaled up by over an order of magnitude. The technology will be applied both ex-situ and in-situ as the process evolves.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a durable artificial
    material capable of life-like motion, contracting and expanding like human muscle
    when controlled by low voltage (12-volt batteries).  This material also will replicate
    human grasp by sensing mechanical pressure across a dynamic range, from gentle
    touch to high impact.  The initial application for this material will be to give
    tactile sensing to fingertips of robotic grippers.  Existing actuators cannot
    provide streamlined expansion and contraction to manage a good grip while dynamically
    sensing grip pressure.  As an extension to the robotic gripper, this material
    could provide a lightweight, intuitively easy-to-operate prosthetic hand.  Other
    applications include creating pads for prosthetic sockets to maintain perfect
    fit; padded liners in football and workplace helmets to absorb forces and communicate
    impact frequency and severity; shoe inserts for athletic and therapeutic footwear
    absorbing force attenuation, measuring step frequency, and measuring foot positioning;
    adjustable lumbar support for seats; switchless consoles for the cockpit, armrests,
    and dashboards of automobiles; and many others. \n \nThis SBIR Phase II project
    will advance robotic grippers by adding a material with sensing capability, with
    implications for prosthetic hands and other applications.  In robotic grippers
    and prosthetic hands, there is a trade-off between strength and dexterity; furthermore,

    gentle pressure has been absent from grip processes, inhibiting handling of delicate
    objects.  The materials under development are shape-morphing and extremely sensitive
    as pressure sensors.  The research objectives and methods/approaches of this project
    are to: 1) advance the actuation speed and durability of these materials through
    synthetic and architectural strategies; 2) characterize the speed and detectable
    pressures through oscilloscopic analysis and amplification circuitry; 3) tie the
    shape-morphing and sensing attributes together through controlled feedback loop(s)
    into off-the-shelf grippers, using robust user-friendly electronics; 4) determine
    durability through long-term cycle testing of contraction/expansion cycles and
    typically encountered grip pressures (millions of cycles for each test method);
    and 5) produce sophisticated robotic grippers with tactile-like touch and compare
    the strength and dexterity with those of the human hand.  The goals and scope
    of this project are to optimize both the shape-morphing and sensing features of

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop technology to bring biomanufactured products to market more rapidly.  Today, biology researchers use genetic engineering to turn microorganisms into living factories: Cells that produce novel therapeutics, foods, materials, and fuels.  This project will make it easier for researchers to evaluate if cells are ready to be promoted from lab-scale to production-scale. New methods for testing microorganisms will be developed, and the cells' growth conditions and media will be evaluated.  This work will allow potential products to be optimized for potency, cost, and production time, enabling researchers to bring their biomanufacturing solutions to market more quickly.  These biomanufactured products provide revolutionary solutions to some of society's biggest challenges including biochmeical production, climate change, plastic pollution, human health, and the sustainability of our food systems.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop technology that will address the challenges faced by researchers seeking to produce novel genetically engineered systems at scale.  Today, evaluating the efficacy and commercialization potential of engineered microorganisms requires considerable empirical work, and this is slowed down by legacy hardware and software systems.  With the goal of improving the time-to-market of these products, this project will create advances in the fields of industrial biotechnology, bioinstrumentation, automation and biological simulation.  Evaluations of these techniques will be conducted using a variety of standard organisms and processes.  Systems will be tested for increased predictive power and gains in efficiency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of an analytical instrument to detect protein changes across all stages of protein production.  The production of highly-engineered therapeutic proteins has outpaced the development of analytical assays to guarantee effectiveness, purity, and shelf life of the drug.  A key control parameter during manufacturing is protein conformation; currently, this is difficult to monitor with commercially available technology. The goal of this project is to provide manufacturers with a new generation of analytical technology that allows them to identify variations between batches. This technology also provides information about product stability so manufacturers can guarantee a longer shelf life for their products, regardless of storage conditions. It is anticipated that this instrument will increase efficacy at all stages, from discovery through scaled-up production and formulation to pre-release certification.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to improve biotherapeutic drug production through the commercialization of analytical technology that provides a new metric for the rapid QC/QA assessment of the conformation of proteins. The gold standard for determining protein conformation is x-ray crystallography - a time-consuming technique that requires high quality crystals and a high-energy physics facility to produce coherent x-rays. The proposed highly sensitive bench-top ion mobility spectrometer detects small variations in the cross-sectional area of a protein and detects small conformational changes. This provides a capability to determine protein stability during discovery when only microgram quantities of recombinantly expressed proteins are available. This process also indicates if a protein refolded after it was subjected to a pH change during purification, and thus it may be used to identify challenges to long-term shelf life. This instrument will be used to demonstrate that for the first time, ion mobility will produce highly-reproducible and biologically relevant measurements of the quality of biomanufactured proteins.

    attack of classical and quantum computers. It has been widely accepted that quantum
    computers will have the ability to solve complex problems, the same complex problems
    many security algorithms are based on, exponentially faster than current computers.
    Even though no quantum computer with serious computing power has yet been built,
    large scale quantum computers are expected to become a reality within the next
    decade. We believe it is necessary to plan for the future as it takes years to

    implement quantum-safe security solutions that will require the integration of
    quantum-safe software and/or hardware cryptographic solutions on resource-constrained
    devices used in embedded systems. As the landscape of connected devices changes
    how the world interacts, the dependence on these systems increases, increasing
    the possibility of exploiting security vulnerabilities. This project will expand
    the knowledge of efficient implementations of quantum-safe security solutions,

    and lightweight security are two main parameters that need to be considered while
    deploying quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms in resource-constrained devices.
    Devices being manufactured today may still be around when quantum computers become
    available and thus need to be secure against them. We plan to employ a special
    class of quantum-safe algorithms based on maps on elliptic curves along with agile
    implementations of cryptographic coprocessors to achieve the required performance
    and security. Cryptosystems based on these maps are known to provide the smallest
    possible key sizes and their security level is determined by a single, simple
    parameter in comparison with other quantum-safe candidates. The hardware designs
    are taken through VLSI design flow to realize the integrated circuits that are
    evaluated for energy/power, area/performance, and security including side-channel
    analysis. The project will generate new insights and results about how to be safe
    and secure in the quantum era. This project will conclude with hardware and software

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a safe, effective, and sustainably-produced natural sunscreen compound, gadusol, to replace harmful ingredients widely used in current sunscreen products. Two to three million cases of skin cancer are reported globally each year, including 132,000 cases of melanoma. In 2015, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention reported 80,442 new cases of melanomas of the skin in the U.S. The potential exists to reverse this trend with effective, safe, aesthetically-pleasing sun protection products that provided long-lasting full-spectrum UV protection. Sustainable production of gadusol and the assurance of its safety and efficacy will enable such products to be developed. With a global sunscreen product market of $16.5 billion and growing, along with the demonstrated need for natural, safer sunscreen actives, this project is poised to have a worldwide, long-term impact on national and global health.

    This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the feasibility of sustainably producing gadusol, a natural, marine-based compound with proven sun protection capability.  Recent research has documented that widely used sunscreen ingredients pose hazards to the environment and possibly to human health, leading to bans on popular sunscreen products. Mineral active compounds such as ZnO and TiO2 are safer substitutes but pose aesthetic disadvantages, leading to products that many consumers dislike. Gadusol has the potential to replace some of these widely-used chemical actives as a safe, effective, and natural UVB blocker. The technical scope proposed includes overcoming obstacles to sustainable production of gadusol using the tools of synthetic biology, establishing gadusol's safety through standard pre-clinical tests, and assessing its efficacy and suitability in prototype formulations (SPF value). Successful completion of this project will reduce the risks of adopting gadusol as a new sunscreen ingredient, enable its commercial production, and provide essential safety data prior to initiating clinical testing required for FDA approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a tool to measure joint mobility. There are a large number of orthopedic injuries and a significant need to quantitatively assess and treat these injuries.  An earlier attempt to address this market using a large, expensive, and cumbersome to use device developed in the 1980's is no longer on the market.  Since that time, technology has significantly evolved, and the device under development will demonstrate that it can provide a better, smaller, cheaper solution with greater orthopedic utility.  This device will be valuable to both educational and clinical venues. There are over 820 educational programs in medicine, chiropractic, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and athletic training.  A device to provide feedback will support joint mobility professionals; the clinical market totals over 1.1 M professionals with projected growth of 14-34% over the next decade.  These clinicians need tools to quantify techniques to enhance the practice of orthopedics. This device will help to transform the ability to collect data on joint measurement procedures to provide literature on examination and treatment efficacy and begin to develop "best practice" protocols.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an orthopedic device to precisely quantify joint mobility.  The proposed device is able to quantify joint laxity to contribute to the clinical decision-making regarding injury management to consistently render therapeutic treatments, improving quality of care.  The proposed technology is a design for a simple, portable, and economical device used between the hands of the clinician and the joint of the patient to measure the linear displacement of the joint's bones.  Aligning the device's axis with the indicated joint results in translation of the device's distal component on the stabilized proximal segment. A display of the linear translation appears immediately.  The device represents a "first-to-market" technology for arthrokinematic/linear assessment.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase II project will be achieved through investigating approaches to leverage extended reality (XR) for immersive, interactive and intelligent training in manufacturing, healthcare and higher education, to accelerate learning, increase engagement, and foster more effective use of expensive equipment. In 2017, the global training market was estimated to be $388 B, while the US market was estimated to be $166 B. Training and design use cases frequently rank among the top 5 XR use cases in industry reports, and the enterprise VR training market alone is forecasted to grow at 140% year over year for the next five years to reach $6.3 B per year. XR technologies hold significant potential by providing users with a sense of presence and immersion heretofore not possible due to cost, safety, security, physical, geographical or other limitations. This project will pursue this growing market opportunity with content expected to bring together classrooms, labs, factories, hospitals and field service environments, broadly advancing learning and engagement in both schools and workplaces.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project lies in the development of high- fidelity modular and reusable virtual object and assembly models, customized models for scenarios, tasks, instructions and user proficiency, application of natural language processing techniques to enable conversational interactions in immersive multiplayer environments and the use of computer vision techniques to support effective reuse of content across both virtual and augmented reality settings. Specialized modules will be developed for each of the above functionalities and then integrated to develop an innovative, easy-to-use product that will make it easy for non-programmers to author and publish XR content for training, design, service and other use cases, as well as collect data to evaluate the content and experiences. Pilot testing will be conducted with users in the higher education industry to rigorously evaluate and iteratively refine the technologies and the final product. By judiciously combining XR, virtual objects, and simulations with voice, vision and collaboration, this project aims to build an innovative product that may enable anyone to build engaging knowledge-rich content.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focuses on the development of a patented radio front-end supporting multi-user MIMO capability for the 5G mm-wave infrastructure market that would enable cost efficient, high data rate access wirelessly as opposed to cost prohibitive fiber-based data connectivity. Cellular and Wi-Fi networks are hitting a spectrum bottleneck in terms of their ability to offer higher data rates to densely populated areas and the same in a cost-efficient manner to remote rural areas. Advent of 5G cellular networks with new bands in the mm-wave frequency spectrum (between 28-70 GHz) alleviates these issues. RF Pixels' innovative mm-wave radio front-end will enable spectrum efficient communication through frequency re-use to spatially separated users at a fraction of the cost compared to known solutions. Thousands of mobile internet users can enjoy high data rates simultaneously without being starved of spectrum. Data heavy paradigms connecting consumer devices and the cloud, such as wireless virtual reality headsets and robotic personal assistants can be implemented with ease. Virtual and augmented reality based remote educational programs, online health care, smart cities, smart transportation and other new low-latency services will be enhanced delivering major economic and societal impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a revolutionary tile architecture that enables massive multi-user MIMO techniques for mm-wave radio systems, without the hardware and power consumption costs of full digital solutions. The radio can efficiently reuse the spectrum between spatially diverse users with active beamforming. Multitude of tiles will be used in a large array making it crucial to achieve excellent power efficiency at the tile level. Tile-to-tile variations hamper accurate beamforming requiring calibration. Beam discovery, refinement and tracking of multiple mobile users simultaneously requires investigation. In Phase I feasibility of a tile architecture that achieves multi-user MIMO and scale to large element arrays was proven. This project will investigate clock generation and coherent distribution to every tile in a large array for accurate beamforming and interference cancellation. Turnkey approach for packaging and antenna array design will be investigated. Impact of tile-to-tile variations on beamforming accuracy and calibration algorithms to mitigate variations will be studied. New algorithms will aim to achieve low-sensitivity to post-calibration errors without much downtime. Beam management algorithms for accurate tracking of mobile users compatible with guidelines of 5G NR standard will be developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a major paradigm shift in the methodology by which waterways can be maintained for optimum usage and water quality. Instead of the status quo in which water quality is only periodically tested and sediment buildups are only removed in massive quantities that can shock sensitive aquatic ecosystems, the system under development offers regular water quality monitoring and regular sediment removal at volumes less impacting to aquatic habitat. Shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular process will allow for reduced pollutant levels in waterways as pollutants are promptly removed instead of continuing to accumulate toxins which, in turn, will increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption, the innovation could impact the technology area of water robotics and potentially have far reaching benefits that assist with water and energy security by keeping the inlet canal's reservoirs that comprise our society's infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue development of an intelligent suction tip via a robotic platform for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways while minimizing harm to marine species. The research seeks to contribute to the knowledge base of marine life behavior and water-pollutant interactions through addressing the need for waterway technologies designed specifically to satisfy the requirements of waterway owners while being sensitive to marine life needs. The project activities include continued technical development and refinement of the environmental niche modeling and suction tip systems whose proof of concept was developed during Phase I activities, refinement and ruggedization of supporting subsystems in preparation for pilot testing, conducting closed environment testing, conducting pilot testing in a local operational waterway, determining a feasible manufacturing roadmap, and conducting pilot testing in an operational waterway in San Francisco Bay while closely documenting its performance and dredged material to determine marine species impact for report to the regulatory agencies. Akabotics expects to prove that its innovative approach has only a minimal impact to marine organisms while providing regulatory agencies with increased oversight and will lay the groundwork for approval to work outside of currently prescribed environmental work windows.

    The broader impact/commercial opportunity of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from creating a paradigmatic shift in the way we achieve seismic protection. The use of mechanical metamaterials fosters new opportunities to increase current levels of seismic protection of buildings and infrastructure, which could ultimately increase the resilience of communities and save lives. Mechanical metamaterials are materials specifically designed to have unprecedented properties. Evolving from a traditional system-based design to a material-based design has the potential of creating seismic solutions that are more customizable and easier to install than most of the current technologies. This technology could replace current seismic protection systems that are traditionally aimed at saving building occupants' lives, but may not address the important equipment therein.  An enhanced level of seismic protection constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities and services requiring continuity of operations after earthquakes. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of increasing the resiliency of communities in seismic prone areas and reduce seismic related direct and indirect losses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for increasing the seismic resilience of our critical infrastructure, and in particular Information Technology (IT) facilities. The projects will result in a revolutionary advance in the seismic protection of vibration sensitive electronic equipment through the use of novel mechanical metamaterials made with an innovative hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) process. The feasibility of combining multiple AM processes to manufacture the multi-component internal architecture of such metamaterials will be demonstrated. In particular, the effectiveness of AM processes in combining hard and soft materials in a highly-complex architecture will be addressed, with the aim of enhancing the design space of the mechanical metamaterial. The effects of this enlarged designed space on the seismic resilience of IT facilities will be investigated by developing a specific seismic resilience framework. The framework will be used to analyze and compare the seismic resilience of data centers with traditional systems and highly customizable metamaterials, as resulting from the manufacturing process.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to introduce a set of powerful neurological
    health metrics for objective and reliable tracking of patient outcomes, clinician
    performance, and therapy efficacy. Significant societal benefits may be realized
    from the introduction of this technology in the clinical applications and clinical
    trials markets. The company's technology is easy to use, reliable, objective and
    cost-efficient. No other existing technology for tracking neurological health
    or patient outcomes shares this set of features. In the company's clinical application,
    the company can close the gap on current health disparities and access for 1)
    those in rural communities, 2) those living in urban islands with limited healthcare
    workforce, and 3) those too sick to travel. It enhances the practice of speech-language
    pathology, enabling rapid objective characterization of speech production to document
    treatment effects. In the clinical trials market, potential impact is enhanced
    by the aging of the global population, and the increasing prevalence of diseases
    such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The company's technology holds promise
    for early detection and sensitive tracking of disease progression that provides
    the opportunity for global-scale impact in drug development for slowing or curing
    neurodegenerative disease. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project aims to address the serious challenge of tapping into brain health
    without expensive and invasive technologies by using speech analysis. Speaking
    is a deceptively complex task. Elaborate brain networks translate thoughts and
    ideas into sequences of movements that produce the sounds of speech. Any disturbance
    in these networks can lead to changes in how we speak and what we say. Research
    shows that subtle changes in speech precede diagnosis of many neurological diseases.
    Leveraging this research, the company built proprietary metrics that use speech
    to capture changes in neurological health. Here the company extends the analytics
    to detect changes in cognitive health as possible early indicators of Alzheimer's
    disease. The company will develop 1) a series of simple tasks to elicit speech
    from an individual using our app; 2) a custom speech recognition platform to automatically
    generate a transcript of what the person said; 3) algorithms to automatically
    analyze the transcript and output clinically interpretable measures of cognitive
    performance. Finally, the company will evaluate the validity/usability of the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop the technical functionality of its cohort recruitment tool that will advance efforts to launch a production quality substance abuse disorder (SUD) research platform designed for use by addiction researchers at universities, academic medical centers, and commercial sector where U.S. publicly-funded research on addictions exceeds $1.4 billion per year. The project will enable the company to contribute directly to broader societal goals of reducing the negative effects and costs of substance abuse, addiction, and treatment services to individuals from all sectors of society (e.g., minorities, veterans, etc.) by enabling addiction researchers to surface novel and more effective addiction recovery supports and interventions essential to enhancing health outcomes and controlling health care costs. The enhanced functionality will provide SUD researchers and stakeholders a unique platform to study and leverage existing evidence to improve treatment protocols, policies, and financing to improve addiction recovery outcomes. Developing the product will enable the company to combine its large mobile recovery community with state-of-the-art research tools that provide significant value to addiction researchers and demonstrate effectiveness to public and private health insurers ? two important target customers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will aid researchers in surfacing novel technical interventions and support scientific methods to improve population health outcomes. Although technologies are emerging to help address recovery support, these have not yet met their full potential for addressing the needs of people striving 24/7 to stay sober, the needs of practitioners including SUD researchers intent on supporting their recovery, and the desire for health insurers to incentivize best practices and to improve health and control costs. The research objectives include expanding on its proof-of-concept for a cohort recruitment tool by building, testing, and implementing a production-ready open-source research platform with enhanced features for conducting scientific studies including participant assessment and intervention scheduling, advanced cohort selection and prospective assignment features, automated study management features, a white label comparison app, highly scalable architecture enabling very large studies, flexible data hosting and management capabilities, and secure software update infrastructure. The result will be an extensible, scalable, and open-source software tool for conducting a broad variety of scientifically rigorous behavioral research studies, including clinical trials.

    cases per year, with an estimated $3000 per QuickFlow catheter, the company's
    estimated target market at minimum 4% penetration within the first three years
    is $18 million. QuickFlow addresses a severely underserved market; hence, maximizing
    the value to both the patient and physicians. The value propositions of faster
    (less than one-hour procedure), safer (no thrombolysis, no vessel wall damage
    and whole clot removal), easy and intuitive to use (similar mechanism of use to
    the existent device), and less procedure cost (1 day in ICU instead of 2-3 days),
    make it appropriate for several key markets, with a global market opportunity
    in excess of $1.53 billion by 2022.  The implications of this device for the thrombectomy

    pulmonary embolism and restore blood flow in 30 minutes of patient?s arrival.
    Reduced time of procedure, use a nonsurgical process, ease of use, and reduced
    cost make this minimally invasive mechanical thrombectomy procedure more desirable
    than the currently available treatment methods. The minimally invasive QuickFlow
    PE, offers these unique features based on the paradigm shifting technological
    innovation in Nitinol device design and manufacturing. The super expandable Nitinol
    baskets completely remove blood clots while significantly reducing the risk of
    complications associated with the current methods of treatment such as internal
    bleeding, and clot fragmentation. A multidisciplinary study on an advanced biomaterial
    and developing a new manufacturing technology has resulted in a paradigm shifting
    medical device which is being studied by a team of engineers, physicians, a sales
    consultant, and a commercial advisor. The team is uniquely positioned to conduct

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to further develop improved biosensing for biomanufacturing. Improved biosensing will enable biomanufacturers to better measure the purity of their products and thus develop processes that result in more pure products. Specifically, this phase II project is to develop a silicon nanowire biosensor from proof of concept to a working platform suitable for initial testing and deployment for the detection of host cell proteins in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. An improved biosensor developed in this project promises to improve yields, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes through higher purity and safer biopharmaceuticals.

    The proposed project will validate the sensor's use, function, and measurement accuracy in comparison to current methods for detection and measurement. The innovation is a low-cost, quantitative biosensor that can detect many different proteins on the same chip and do so even when the proteins are present at a low concentration level.  The company will use vertically aligned silicon nanowire arrays, an inexpensive process to make nanowires, and a device design that eliminates the difficulties in electrically contacting nanowire arrays. The company will fully characterize the sensor's response and compare this response to the metrics that are currently used in the industry.  In order to achieve this goal, they will increase the process throughput required to make these sensors, set manufacturing controls to achieve an acceptable consistency in the sensors, measure the response of these sensors over a wide range of protein concentration values, and build a validation package to assist customers in their implementation for using these sensors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the widespread adoption of an efficient and accessible technology to integrate patient photographs with radiology images to improve patient safety, increase healthcare efficiency, and reconnect radiologists with their patients. A successful commercialization outcome is this adoption leading to direct cost-savings in healthcare by improving patient safety and hospital quality; even a 10% improvement in radiologists' efficiency leads to healthcare savings of ~$900 million. The broader impact of this novel technology is that it can provide patient authentication for the digital data being generated by hundreds of new digital medical devices. Any of this digital data could end up in the wrong patient's medical record and authentication is crucial.  Rapid advances in smart, telehealth systems present the danger that patients can turn into mere data, but these photographs can return the interpreting physician's focus to the patient, leading to improved outcomes through patient-centered care. The technology achieves this by allowing doctors to connect with the patient as a person before diving deep and exploring data at anatomic, physiologic and molecular levels.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will seamlessly and securely integrate a radiology patient identification system to improve patient safety, by avoiding preventable errors, and enhance throughput. This transformative approach overcomes the failure of existing patient identification methods while harnessing the power of an embedded camera system to improve patient care. Technology to automatically and simultaneously obtain and embed audio and video data of the patient during X-ray and CT acquisition will be developed under this award. Specifically, the following objectives will be completed: 1) develop a mature software framework for rapid system scalability to a large number of hospitals, 2) expand the system to CT scanners and stationary X-ray machines, 3) improve image quality by adding infrared stereoscopic image capture, to ensure photographs add value even when obtained in low light settings, 4) enhancing the cameras with video and audio capabilities, which will improve patient identification, while simultaneously gathering rich clinical information, and 5) refine the triggering method for photograph acquisition. The long-term objectives are to increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors by embedding an intrinsic, externally visible biometric identifier with medical imaging studies; and increase interpreting physician throughput by decreasing interpretation time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the number of users within an organization that can carry out sophisticated data analysis. The proposed approach, if proven successful, can also open a new vertical in the analytics market in which text-based chatbots aid humans in carrying out the task of creating, deploying and running complex data science pipelines. Such a positive outcome could lead to the creation of a sub-market in the existing analytic software market, and it could also help improve the productivity of the (non-technology) sectors of the economy that increasingly require high-quality and fast insights from both archival and real-time datasets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project targets the issue that it currently can take substantial human effort and time to extract meaningful insights from data. The company aims to change this cumbersome process by training text-based chatbots to perform complex analysis tasks on enterprise data. These chatbots then allow users to acquire answers about their data by chatting in (a controlled subset of) written English. Instead of dedicating hours or even days to answer a single question, large datasets could then be queried multiple times in minutes, enabling businesses to make informed decisions in real-time. Thus, this technology aims to dramatically improve human productivity in gathering insights from data and democratize data analytics by making it available to a broad class of users within an enterprise.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to ultimately develop a nose-on-a-chip to establish the first-ever digital database of smell. By interfacing the biology of the human nose with a read-out platform, it will be possible to decode the human sense of smell and open up new possibilities. Such a nose-on-a-chip and its associated smell database has multiple commercial applications in the fragrance and flavor industry including increasing the efficiency of developing aroma chemicals for food, personal hygiene or household use, and fine perfumes.  Also, it may be possible to identify specific malodor receptors and developing compounds that block repulsive odors or modulate olfaction (boost smell capacity and/or suppress odor cravings). In addition, the smell database can be employed to develop algorithms that predict how new aroma chemicals will smell before making them. There is an additional opportunity for the nose-on-a-chip in the healthcare industry when applied to sniff out disease-associated odors, such as Parkinson's disease. Odor-based disease detection may revolutionize biomarker discovery and may have a significant impact on R&D spending in the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately decrease treatment cost for patients.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to produce an odor-specific nose-on-a-chip assay containing a subset of odorant receptors that can report the presence of a specific odor (odor MS1) and its derivatives. This minimal viable platform is based on a well-validated need in the fragrance and flavor industry and needs to demonstrate sensitivity, specificity, selectivity and intensity (S3I) of odor activation.  The goals are to identify a set of high-affinity odor MS1 receptors, generate engineered mice for each receptor through this validated platform technology and demonstrate S3I using an established ex vivo bio-assay. Engineered mice form the basis of the proposed commercial platform. They are the bioreactors producing the olfactory extracts that are used in the ex vivo bioassay and, ultimately, are integrated with a silicon chip.  As such, optimized generation of mice is key to cost-efficient scaling of the proposed commercial chips and is a primary objective of the project. The plan is to develop a high-throughput method of generating any receptor in mice. Then, the goal is to develop an optimized gene-targeted line that will serve as a standardized template for future knock-ins of any odorant receptor gene, providing a streamlined, standardized and scalable method to ultimately establish the complete library.

    This STTR Phase 2 project is aimed at providing technology to address the high costs of developing effective and safe drugs. Bringing a new drug to market typically involves screening 100's of thousands of compounds for efficacy and toxicity utilizing cell, tissue and animal models to ultimately select a lead compound that will be tested in clinical trials. This process can take years, billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during clinical trials due to safety concerns. Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity. Combined with optical sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure of the tissue to libraries of drugs. This technological platform provides resolution of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and the market. In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual's own tumor or tissue, and environmental health.

    Measuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed. The technology utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function, and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps, and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA. In this Phase 2 STTR proposal, the company will build two 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality of a low-capacity (16- channel) system has been previously demonstrated. The funding will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical industry.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology to improve
    the accuracy of skeletal evaluation within developmental and reproductive toxicology
    (DART) studies.  The goal is to better ensure that potential therapeutics, cosmetics
    and agrochemicals do not cause teratogenic effects. Today, DART studies rely upon
    the subjective human-based manual evaluation of animal skeletons for defects,
    which has a low sensitivity for defects, significant inter and intra pathologist
    variability, and is laborious and costly. The technology under development is
    based on a novel imaging and automated analysis solution for this problem that
    will shift the paradigm of skeletal evaluation from a qualitative to quantitative
    approach. Through improving DART study accuracy, the objective is to better detect
    teratogenic effects of compounds, reduce the overall number of animals required
    for these studies, and reduce the cost to develop therapeutics by improving throughput
    and reducing study cost. The market opportunity for this technology is expected

    The broader societal impact/commercial potential of this project centers on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals suffering from motor dysfunction due to stroke, spinal cord injury, and other conditions. In the US alone, there are 600,000 new stroke patients each year who rely on conventional one-on-one therapies for recovery. Due to cost and labor limitations they do not receive consistent, frequent, and intensive training needed for full recovery and optimal quality of life. As a result, stroke care guidelines recommend robotic rehabilitation in all care settings. Providing robotic rehabilitation using the proposed exoskeleton robots is a compelling solution for hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and senior living communities. In addition to providing frequent and intensive therapy, the devices can accurately measure patient progress and performance for personalized care. The exoskeletons are also a powerful research tool into effective rehabilitation methods and have the potential to transform the manufacturing sector by providing a solution for industrial processes that are too complex for full automation and too physically demanding for humans. The proposed exoskeleton devices reduce the risk of injury from accidents and overexertion for individuals performing repetitive, high-stress tasks. Additional results include increased productivity and decreased absenteeism and turn-over.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of exoskeleton robots targeted at rehabilitation. A substantial portion of the US population requires intensive rehabilitation services for neuromuscular impairment. Robotic rehabilitation has attracted attention due to the potential for better patient outcomes. Current robotic solutions lack the anatomical mobility and compliant dynamic behavior to produce neurologically-sound therapeutic behaviors. The proposed project addresses these deficits and will result in exoskeleton robots capable of essential advanced rehabilitation behaviors. During the Phase I project, a high-performance, force-controlled actuator was developed and will be the core component enabling the desired behavior. In this project, the physical structures and control algorithms of the exoskeletons will be designed and built with a focus on dynamic transparency and kinematic compatibility with the human body to capitalize on the capabilities of the actuator. Additionally, the control software will use feedback loops and a visually interactive environment with performance metrics to keep patients engaged.

    the need for numerous chemicals in existing detergent formulations. Commercialization
    of the proposed dual-function detergent molecule eliminates the need for chemicals
    commonly used to maintain the function in hard water conditions. Reduction of
    the amount and number of chemicals needed in a detergent formulation will enable
    production of 25% more concentrated detergent products, reducing packaging costs

    the carbon footprint of detergent chemical production by using plant-based starting
    materials instead of the current petroleum-based products, which currently dominate
    the industry. Additionally, reduction in the amount of chemicals used in detergents
    reduces environmental impact to water resources and wildlife. \n\t\nThis SBIR
    Phase II proposes to further develop a bi-functional surfactant chemical for laundry
    detergent applications, including (1) identification of a best performing surfactant
    for commercialization, (2) development of a scaled synthesis process using a high-throughput
    automated reactor system, and (3) demonstration of the performance of the material
    in laundry detergent formulations and measure the cleaning performance of generated

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to serve the breast cancer community. In 2015 there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer. The surgical procedure cost ~$6000 with an average $60 per minute cost and 25% re-operation rate. Owing to its competitive advantages, the AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical delay and potentially minimize the re-excision rate. Therefore, AcouStar can effectively reduce the surgical cost for the hospital, the reimbursement cost for the insurance company, and physical pain and emotional distress for the patients. The company's innovation addresses a considerable market opportunity. According to a market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value the company may potentially provide, the total addressable market is estimated to be ~$200 million in 2020. This innovation will not only be applicable for breast cancer surgery navigation, it may also be used as an internal tracking device for multiple other applications, such as implantable device tracking, endoscope tracking, navigation for partial kidney removal etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to solve the problems of surgical navigation in lumpectomy. Breast conserving therapy, or lumpectomy, with radiation therapy has become a preferable choice over mastectomy for its better cosmetic outcome and patient health care. However, it is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. Current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Vibronix, Inc proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this device, named the AcouStar system, has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays, and reduce the re-excision rate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop instrumentation that will allow researchers to elucidate fundamental interactions at the atomic scale that occur at high-temperature and various timescales.  From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

    game challenge where students work together within an active, simulated environment
    to collect and analyze data, construct explanations, then test and iterate solutions
    to a problem. Only 22% of the United States? graduating high school seniors are
    proficient in science. This is important due to the estimated 2.4 million unfilled
    jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) in the United States,
    to provide higher-paying STEM jobs to citizens, and promote a scientifically literate
    citizenry. Recent research supports new approaches for how to improve this scientific
    literacy, and states across the country are adopting new science standards to
    support this effort. The outcome of this project will support development of students'
    scientific literacy with a novel approach which utilizes cooperative, interdisciplinary,
    problem-based learning within a video game. Commercialization of this product
    will transform the process of inquiry-based learning by putting the tools in the
    hands of student scientists as they test their own solutions. The project supports
    the NSF's mission by empowering students to develop strong science and engineering
    skills, as well as supporting development of 21st century skills such as collaboration
    and problem solving that are desired by employers. \n\n\nThe technology developed
    by this Phase II project will produce a group problem-solving experience for up
    to five students to analyze a problem and implement an engineering solution within
    a live simulated environment, providing educators with a powerful curricula tool
    to engage their students in the real problem-solving cycles a scientist would
    engage in, within a feasible setting using the video game. The research goals
    include creating a flexible content authoring tool that designers and educators
    can use to generate their own unique scenarios and creating an easy-to-use educator
    dashboard to accompany it. The content authoring and customization options empower
    educators to reflect local context, student interest, and student background knowledge,
    strategies which are essential for educators of diverse populations currently
    underrepresented within STEM. The technology and its dashboard will also serve
    as a powerful formative assessment tool, enabling group assessment that is able
    to parse group and individual participation, and is designed to promote balanced
    group problem solving. The result of this research will create a uniquely flexible
    tool that will enable educators to engage learners in deeper, contextual learning,
    encourage transfer of information, cooperative learning, development of science
    and engineering skills such as data literacy, and be utilized for assessment of

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

    segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior
    wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment
    breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of
    eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors

    a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal
    of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impacts
    other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries.
    \n\nThe technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular.
    The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including
    a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall,
    and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept
    is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one
    another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much
    like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would
    move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint
    in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating
    the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology
    has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding
    industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and
    increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently
    tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber
    tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.\n\nThis award reflects

- abstractText: "Fuel burned for industrial process heat accounts for 20%-30% of all
    carbon emissions on the face of the earth. Yet no emissions-free solutions for
    process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel.
    Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel creates
    energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are threatened,
    it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.\nThe impact
    of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source of high
    temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions,
    improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify America?s energy
    supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will offset 29,900 gallons
    of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven envisions doing thousands
    of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across the globe. One day IMA
    technology may even enable rural areas and developing nations to leapfrog natural
    gas distribution infrastructure in the same way that cellphones have leapfrogged
    landlines. This project is an opportunity for the United States to take a leadership
    role in technology to enable these societal changes.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project will address a key barrier to solar thermal deployment
    in the industrial sector: lack of an effective interface to connect high temperature
    solar thermal system with legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces
    are limited to low temperatures (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes
    that are prone to failure. They suffer from poor reliability and create severe
    maintenance headaches, rendering them unusable in the industrial sector.  These
    systems also typically require the host facility to be take offline during installation
    ? an costly sacrifice in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are
    particularly problematic, as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures
    condensate return systems that rarely drop below 100?C.  \nSkyven?s system-level
    innovations solve these challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal
    collectors a practical and financially-attractive option for industries such as
    food processing.  Phase II research will implement two innovations in particular:
    (1) solar steam injection into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless
    control with automated optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe
    stagnation/overheat protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature
    operation up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a
    real-world industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering
    concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited test
    time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in the space
    of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems can be
    integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing, without
    require rework of the existing control systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    viable real time optical imaging device to address the problem of failed first
    time vascular access.  Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive
    procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone,
    there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access
    has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain
    and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure
    rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.
    \ Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When
    PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access
    is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications.
    One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length
    of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3
    billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates
    occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve
    first time IV access. \n\nIn phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid
    Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access,
    and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported
    by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath
    needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming
    intra lumen placement.  The system needs to be cost effective, durable and acceptable
    to a multitude of diverse clinicians. The disposable adapter probe will connect
    to a hand piece that will tactilely enable the clinician to actuate rotation and
    advancement of the optical probe to acquire data necessary to create clinically
    relevant 3D real time images.  The data are transmitted to a control unit for

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the $4B/year cover lens market an economically viable material for the upcoming form-factor it must address: foldable displays. While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will allow highly cost effective, 2-way communications to be delivered to machinery and 'Things' over extremely long and non-line-of-sight distances using underutilized frequencies and new hardware and software techniques. The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (Satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things applications. Further, the work will have broad impact in allowing more balanced utilization of the radio spectrum which cannot be addressed (either economically or at all) with legacy wireless techniques.

    The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will build on our Phase I accomplishments to create production-ready designs of two new wireless systems, signal processing software to allow use of challenging spectrum while avoiding existing users, create the first instance of a cloud based infrastructure for automated control and coordination of our architecture, and, the creation of a basic set of deployment tools and techniques to support field operations. We expect to continue building a significant base of Intellectual Property as we pursue the work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the technology provides health care systems with a very accurate view of what their patients experience during health care encounters - what is going well and importantly, what specific problems are frustrating patients. With this insight, providers are able to quickly and efficiently resolve issues. Patients are increasingly active in deciding where they receive care.  As health care spending declines, providers find themselves competing for patients. To attract patients and drive market share, health systems must deliver not just excellent clinical care but also positive patient experiences.  Patients that have a negative health care encounter often choose to go elsewhere.  When they do, providers lose margin.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the industry need for better insight on how to quickly and efficiently improve patient experiences.  Surveys which are the norm in health care fail to deliver service failure details.  The company's software goes beyond current text analysis solutions by automating the classification of patient feedback based on the ideas and sentiment expressed by patients. These results are converted into precise analytics and displayed in dashboards so front-line managers can quickly identify problems and make rapid improvements in patient experiences.  Previously the company demonstrated the technical feasibility of its software by focusing on a narrow set of providers.  This research will refine the software so that it is capable of analyzing patient feedback across a wide range of health care organizations. What operational changes will have the greatest, positive impact on patient loyalty and market share?  Results from this project will answer that question for a broad range of health care organizations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to him or her. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has three major research objectives: scaling the technology to teams of 10,000+ people; faithfully translating the user experience to mobile devices; and developing techniques for serving the needs of diverse deployments large and small. For scalability, one major area is "presence", telling each user who else is currently online. Presence data naturally grows with the number of pairs of users, therefore much faster than the number of users, and the company will need to develop algorithms to focus presence on significant connections between users. Among the unique challenges on mobile, the often-limited Internet connectivity demands algorithms that remember data previously fetched from the server to avoid asking for it again, carefully balanced with getting needed updates to never show out-of-date information to the user; the immediacy required for a great chat experience makes both horns of this dilemma especially sharp. Serving diverse deployments demands techniques for making software updates routine and seamless, a practice recently popularized in browsers and mobile apps but rarely accomplished to date in distributing server applications such as that described here.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an instrument that alleviates several
    current difficulties in the growth measurement of many microbes, especially anaerobic
    and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally
    occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles
    in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response,
    and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier
    of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases,
    such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current
    measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments
    and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet
    need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing
    quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput
    experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into
    various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows.
    The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million
    and growing.  This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture
    growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader
    that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth
    of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational
    biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data,
    and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach.
    However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current
    instruments' complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development
    of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader,
    expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics)
    to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify
    the instrument's electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered
    operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment
    to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array
    of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal
    is to solidify the device's mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in
    a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional
    wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote
    use in any environment.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on advancing the domestic manufacturing capabilities for high-value nanomaterials for new membrane materials. Previously, the company has developed a novel membrane material with considerable economic, environmental, and nutritional impact in industrial process applications. Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food & beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical/petrochemical refining.

    Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is < 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

Our initial target verticals: Security and Surveillance, Predictive Maintenance, and Healthcare represent hundreds of billions USD in growth markets for IoT devices and substantially more economic impact through improved efficiency in deployment and operations and reduced societal costs. Improved performance, power consumption and scalability of these key technologies will lead to improved public safety, improved intelligence in home healthcare services, and more efficient manufacturing and energy systems through deployment of Predictive Maintenance technologies on key industrial equipment. Wide deployment of these technologies will lead to substantial energy savings and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, reduced economic loss due to negative events, improved scalability and response time to predicted or active negative events, and lower cost in deployment and operations due to low cost, low power, and physically small sensor systems.

    The proposed project focuses on design of high performance, energy-efficient platforms for ML applications, and associated design tools and libraries. Neural networks are heavily used for many machine learning problems but optimizing for efficient deployment currently requires extensive trial-and-error for the large design space of options. Our deep neural network (DNN) optimization framework applies bit-width optimizations, weight sharing and pruning automatically to reduce computation and weight storage demands by more than 10X, while analyzing quality of results impact and using fine-tuned retraining to minimize or eliminate accuracy degradation. Our high level synthesis (HLS) tool then translates optimized networks to hardware while applying pipelining, functional unit parallelism, resource sharing, and platform-specific optimizations. Together these tools automate and accelerate the process of analyzing, optimizing and implementing ML for hardware deployment, reducing time and required expertise for hardware design. Our deployment platforms are modular, composable platforms for small, low-cost deployments of audio/video signal processing, feature extraction and classification, systems control (e.g. pan-tilt-zoom cameras), and communications to decision-making or cloud services. We will extend competitive advantages from our Phase I project with features for solutions in the security/surveillance, predictive maintenance, and healthcare verticals, and tight integration of platforms, tools and IP libraries.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will transform how alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
    are diagnosed, monitored, and treated by the further development of a micro-biosensor
    system for health care providers.  An implantable micro-biosensor that reliably
    detects, monitors, and tracks alcohol consumption allows for more accurate diagnosis
    so the appropriate treatment solution can be prescribed and tracked. Our system
    integrates an implantable micro-biosensor with smartphone technology to continuously
    detect and monitor, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata, pushing
    resulting behavior change instructions to the user.  This creates a revolutionary
    approach to the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorders by reporting
    outcome data more accurately and reliably than current, self-reporting methods.
    Our system potentially yields multiple societal benefits, including lower treatment
    costs and increased treatment accessibility. Additionally, it could reduce both
    economic and social costs through the identification of people at risk thereby
    increasing the number of people who seek and receive treatment.  \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on refining the
    design and functionalization of an injectable alcohol micro-biosensor, developing
    a wearable device, and testing the alcohol micro-biosensor in animals. Once fully
    developed, our system for detecting, monitoring, and treating alcohol use disorders
    will consist of three components: 1) a multi-plex micro-biosensor, small enough
    to be directly injected under the skin. The sensor is customizable to continuously
    monitor and measure alcohol; 2) a wearable sensor device that provides power to
    the injected micro-biosensor while collecting the measured data to transmit to
    a nearby smartphone or other data aggregator; and 3) a mobile smartphone application
    developed by our company that uses evidence-based psychotherapy techniques to
    encourage behavior modification. The anticipated technical results include an
    implantable micro-biosensor for the continuous monitoring and measuring of alcohol
    consumption. Additionally, an unobtrusive wearable device that can power the biosensor
    and store and transmit the data collected is anticipated. Both of these components
    will have been tested in animals and be ready to move on to testing in humans.\n\nThis

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create an economical, light&#8208;weight,
    high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer to allow testing of air and fossil
    fuels for the presence of harmful compounds. A frequency domain THz spectrometer
    is capable of characterizing the different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample.
    Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because
    of their size and complexity but recent technical advancements have made it possible
    to build a spectroscopic THz sensor small enough and light enough to be flown
    on a consumer drone. The reductions in size and cost have opened the door to using
    THz sensors for emissions testing of ships entering U.S. waters or contaminant
    testing of fossil fuels at petroleum processing facilities. This is significant
    because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of
    collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. flammable compounds
    or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification
    to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local
    environment. \n\nThe proposed project will produce the first article of a compact,
    battery operated, autonomously operating spectroscopic THz sensor capable of mixed
    gas analysis to parts per million sensitivities. It will be constructed predominantly
    from economical off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf fiber optic components in a novel highly
    compact, light&#8208;weight form factor. In order to achieve the high sensitivities,
    the spectroscopic THz sensor will incorporate: high fidelity lasers from the telecommunications

    photomixers, a folded, light&#8208;weight, carbon fiber sample cell incorporating
    patented 3D printed mirror technology and a patented optical phase&#8208;modulation
    technique that removes the effects of coherent detection. The instrument will
    first be employed for laboratory based measurements of sulfur-containing contaminants
    in gas flows. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument,
    a first article will be used in initial testing and collaborative field work.
    Sales of a larger laboratory instrument based on the same technology will begin
    simultaneously.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    This STTR Phase II project will focus on the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with operating temperatures >700?C. In the Phase I of this research, an additive package was developed that formed an adherent ceramic oxide coating on 316/316L stainless steel at the temperatures >700?C when added to specific chloride salt blends and inhibit corrosion. The utilization of the inhibitor package strategy will enable the utilization of economical stainless-steel alloys in the CSP plants and would reduce the infra-structure cost. Such solutions will have a direct impact on the renewable energy market which would help to lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for thermal solar from the current cost of 12?/kwh to the target 3?/kwh by 2030. The scientific and technological insight gained in this project could be beneficial to many other applications, such as molten carbonate fuel cells, thermal energy storage systems, nuclear molten fluoride/chloride reactors, and other high-temperature systems that are susceptible to aggressive corrosion. Incorporation of the inhibited molten chloride salt in the CSP plants will also provide sustainable green energy, reduce water usage, create more jobs and offer U.S. energy independence and security. On a societal level, impact will be achieved by the continued delivery and development of educational activities based on the research topics embodied by this work.


    The core innovation in this proposed program is the development of a chemical mixture, an additive package that would minimize the corrosion of stainless steel induced by molten chloride salts at temperatures >700?C. The additive package reacts with the stainless steel and forms a corrosion inhibiting ceramic oxide coating in-situ when added to the molten chlorides at operating temperatures>700?C. The chloride salts are proposed to be the heat transfer fluids for third generation CSP plants. The feasibility of the inhibitor package strategy in a real world CSP plant will be critically assessed in this proposed research. A prototype bench scale molten test loop will be designed and built to mimic the flow conditions in a CSP plant. The effect of prolonged exposure to high temperature molten salts on the mechanical properties of the base metal under dynamic conditions will be studied with attention to the molten salt induced degradation of strength and toughness at elevated temperatures. The degradation behavior of the salt with the inhibitor package will be studied as well. Additional research will be performed to gain fundamental insight on the nucleation and growth of the ceramic oxide coating and its thermal and mechanical stability in dynamic flow conditions.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections.

Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to engineer loblolly pine to increase wood density (yield) by 20% with no additional land, water, or fertilizer use requirements.  With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree's natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States' position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, "gene trait" method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity.Â 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.Â

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for
    the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced
    annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum
    or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly
    used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and
    toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules
    capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms
    that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like
    sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact
    of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria
    as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project
    will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments
    for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria
    will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,
    such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process
    in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and
    reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source
    of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,
    wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly
    generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria
    strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products
    for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural
    pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date.

In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is as follows. Commercially, the technology described
    herein has the capability to provide faster, granular, dynamic information about
    safety and security, globally, to firms, universities, governments, and NGOs.
    This project uses novel methods to improve Natural Language Processing and Machine
    Learning. As a result, better geo-parsing of digital sources of news about security
    will result in risk content that can be aggregated, displayed, and analyzed in
    original ways. This enables security managers at these organizations to better
    understand risk and protect their staff, providing a higher quality of care. For
    non-governmental organizations (including firms), this enables improved decision-making
    about operations, travel, and investment. For governments, this enables improved
    physical security resource allocation. Socially, this project has the potential
    to improve transparency and accountability regarding trends about safety and security,
    by improving the aggregation and visualization of data. As an example, groups
    of firms and governments in emerging markets can collectively identify previously
    unnoticed patterns of insecurity, in support of public accountability. \n \nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an innovation over
    the state of the art in the following ways. First, this project builds on current
    geo-parsing extraction methodologies by adding methodologies unique to the safety
    and security space. Second, this project uses external data sources for cross
    correlations to improve the \"aboutness\" and granularity of extracted reports.
    Third, this project exploits contributions from users at the organizational level
    - as well as individuals. That is, this project supports the growth of an ecosystem
    in which human users of information also contribute to the quality, volume, and
    timeliness of that information. This contribution is also intended to improve
    the geo-parsing methodologies via machine learning. The opportunity is the improvement
    of geo-parsing extraction mechanisms. The research objectives are to test the
    hypotheses that NLP algorithms can exploit patterns unique to the safety and security
    space; that external sources of news can be exploited for improved granularity
    and \"aboutness\" scores; and that user-generated content can serve to support
    an ecosystem of information sharing. The anticipated results are that the above
    innovations will result in usability scoring sufficient for the safety and security
    use case."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from addressing the
    important hand gesture based input challenges of VR/AR (expected to grow to $150B by
    2020), Robotics and IoT ($135B by 2019 and $1.7T by 2020 respectively). This technology,
    if successful in mitigating the high technical risks, represents a huge leap in the state of the
    art in 3D hand models for gesture recognition and has the potential to be the industry
    standard for AR, VR, Robotics and IoT applications with broad societal impact in education,
    medical and healthcare. Its broader impact is further amplified by the potential in serving the
    needs of the disabled community in improving their quality of life by being better able to
    communicate, learn and adapt to their interaction needs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to significantly
    advance current 3D hand gesture recognition technology by developing a dynamic hand
    tracking model for gesture intent recognition. It is robust against occlusion and tolerant to
    variations in camera orientation and position. This research will result in a transformative
    leap above the current state of academic and commercial hand models and overcome key
    technical hurdles that have so far proven difficult to overcome. It solves the following key
    challenges and involves very high technical risks: 1) robust hand tracking while holding
    objects and 2) robust tangible interactions using objects without using any fiducial markers
    2) low profile hand wearable for touch interaction detection. This Phase 2 project will
    achieve these objectives by 1) data acquisition and hand-object pose estimation, 2)
    understanding user intents with enhanced tangible interactions, and 3) system validation
    and user testing.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a
    microbial process for the economical and sustainable production of a highly potent
    natural acaricide, which is a pesticide that kills mites and ticks.  Increasing
    wariness of synthetic insecticides combined with the need to prevent tick-borne
    illnesses creates a tremendous opportunity for natural acaricides. The project's
    terpene target has long been known as a highly effective and safe acaricide; however,
    its commercialization has been hampered by a high cost of production. The aim
    is to develop an alternative manufacturing process for biosynthetic production
    enabling the cost reductions required to effectively penetrate the $1.6 B acaricide
    market. Because the target is GRAS and because it has been used extensively as
    a food ingredient for decades, there is a compelling safety benefit combined with
    its potent efficacy, which may spur increased spraying in public areas and private
    residences. Overall, this project will provide a new sustainable, cost-effective
    production route, thereby enabling acaricide commercialization. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase II project will lead to sustainable, scalable, and economical access to
    a highly potent natural acaricide.  A commercial fermentation process will be
    developed by employing advanced metabolic engineering and protein engineering
    approaches for improving strain and enzyme performance.  Achieving these production
    metrics will enable formulation and commercialization of various acaricidal products,
    including yard/area sprays, which will allow better control of tick populations
    and halt the spread of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease.  In addition,
    this work will significantly advance the understanding of producing complex plant
    natural ingredients, thus providing economical and scalable commercial access
    to a wide array of compounds with significant potential benefit."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential
    of the technology to dramatically reduce the cost and risk currently associated
    with production of bio-based products, enabling ultra-low cost product development.
    The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting
    the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and
    basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more
    difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into
    a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and
    production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable,
    high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development
    of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost
    enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise
    not have acceptable internal return on development capital. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that
    enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which
    bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches,
    relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context
    of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected
    wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial
    complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the
    kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized
    design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological
    design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs
    of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain
    construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results
    in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that
    are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability
    from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented
    bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance
    from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

    with state-of-the-art video proprietary technology, and allow collaboration between
    students and teachers located anywhere in the country. Commercialization of this
    technology will provide school districts with a needed educational tool to help
    teachers direct and assess STEM activities, and support students as they learn
    critical thinking skills and master STEM concepts, a mastery fundamental to successful

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the performance of the computational back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes,
    potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and
    Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable
    compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating
    shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists
    expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.
    \ Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety
    with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple
    information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is
    made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs,
    hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected
    patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase
    I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management
    that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.
    \ Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications
    and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and
    potentially saving lives.  \n\n\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded
    label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide
    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the
    first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive
    test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material
    properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate
    tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline
    transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of
    the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and
    leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission
    pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked
    to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary
    strength data.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during
    the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets
    can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable
    within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic
    pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the
    asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. \n\nThe overall
    technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research
    and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system
    integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable
    nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data.
    The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling
    the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test
    units.  Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field
    environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone
    2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion
    of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services.
    \ Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the
    system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall
    goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to
    enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections."

    Miniaturization across a range of sectors is driving the development of devices
    and materials at increasingly minute length scales. Multiple large-scale trends
    including mobile devices and the internet-of-things are driving an unprecedented
    volume of engineering at the nanoscale. Much of this is now dependent on the single-tip

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow the Internet infrastructure to keep
    up with explosive growth demand.  A core aspect of Internet operational viability
    is switching speed of optical devices at various points of the transmission, storage,
    calculation, and access chain.  Current technologies are not poised to be able
    to meet the speed and stability needs of the projected growth in Internet data
    volumes and access speed requirements.  These are currently growing well beyond
    a Moore's Law pace.  Needed is a disruptive approach to optical switching that
    will allow data management to keep pace with market needs.  Ability to delivery
    this essential capability will provide not only essential international leadership
    in internet services, but also avail companies involved in the innovation to make
    a substantial commercial impact directly for their shareholders and to those of
    their partners and affiliates.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research phase
    II project is an effort to cross the chasm between fundamental new physics insights
    relating to the structure of matter and an aggressive approach to commercializing
    'Semiconductors of Light' in an emerging market for high density optical interconnects
    priced for datacenters. Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids
    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices
    of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential
    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important
    photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization
    methods."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to rapidly engineer yeast for
    production of fuels, chemicals, enzymes, and other valuable molecules. Yeast offers
    high value production capabilities; however, engineering new strains is very complex
    and expensive - costing approximately $75-100 million, and requiring 7-10 years
    for development with current engineering methods. This project will develop a
    genome engineering technology for yeast that can substantially reduce the cost
    and time for developing new strains for industrial biotechnology applications.
    This technology will increase the ability of companies to use yeast to efficiently
    produce high-quality products from renewable feedstocks, and help grow the overall
    industrial biotechnology market. \n \nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    the ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains.
    Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical
    or fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming. Multiplex
    Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that provides a
    powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced cost. Until
    recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli, possessing key genetic
    features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed us to port MAGE to yeast,
    and the goal of this project is to increase efficiency of the system and endow
    existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo MAGE. The goal is to improve
    MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-throughput system to rapidly create
    and quantify strain variants for their capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself.
    This project will establish a system to identify and optimize the requisite genetic
    features for MAGE in yeast, in order to rapidly engineer industrial yeast strains

    the precision of microtechnology with low-power microfluidics to realize a fully-implantable
    micropump specifically tailored for drug delivery applications in rodents. Currently,
    drug administration is predominantly conducted by manual handling and needle injection
    which is labor-intensive, induces stress and other ?white-coat? effects and is
    limited to simple drug release profiles. There is a need for advanced drug administration
    capability in animals that enables new complex dosing profiles, provides automation
    for chronic studies, and improves scientific validity. Technical challenges include
    the development of a low-power inductively-powered pump actuator, ten-fold pump
    miniaturization and wireless control of a large number of implanted pumps. The
    research objectives are (1) to optimize pump performance and usability (2) to
    extend cage size compatibility and connectivity (3) to optimize software usability
    (4) to optimize system design and establish quality assurance processes for scale-up
    and (5) to conduct an in-vivo validation study.  Successful demonstration of the
    remotely-controlled implantable infusion pump system will enable new dosing schemes,
    provide precise temporally controlled dosing for more reproducible results from
    acute and chronic studies, and enable new approaches to drug therapy that would
    not otherwise be possible. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this
    project lies in uniquely improving scientific outcomes and facilitating the drug
    development/discovery process. Currently, only one in 10,000 drug candidates successfully
    attain FDA approval with a significant number of candidates failing or discarded
    due to inadequate drug administration.  Rapid and accurate evaluation of efficacy,
    safety and toxicity early in the drug development process is improved through
    the fully automated, wirelessly-controlled drug dosing technology supported by
    this Phase II project.  This project targets the international laboratory animal
    market estimated at $3.4B in 2012. Animal models are employed throughout the drug
    development pipeline and in particular, rodents are critical to drug candidate
    target validation, screening, and optimization. Included in this effort are several
    significant first-to-market capabilities such as chronic dosing capability in
    freely-moving, tether-free mice and high-throughput evaluation of multiple new

    In radiation oncology, only a small fraction of the valuable data produced during
    routine patient care is leveraged for the care of new patients. High-dose curative
    treatments frequently lead to side effects, such as dry mouth in head and neck

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a new instrument for biological research, biomedical research, and biopharmaceutical drug development. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful technology with great potential for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that contributed to the DNA sequencing revolution.  The technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. This new system could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology may be of value not only in biopharmaceutical and biochemical research markets but also in food, clinical, and environmental analyses.

    The project will develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows efficient separation and characterization of several biochemical species, including proteins. The CE-ESI-MS technology will be developed for ease of use. It will use a novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation to allow analysis from 1 microliter or less volume for small samples. In addition, the instrument will utilize a novel electrospray ionization interface with integrated optical detection. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination may represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. With simple automated design and ease of use, the technology may significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    Phase II project is to eliminate the medical communityâs dependence on heparin
    derived from animal sources. Heparin is an essential anticoagulant drug currently
    produced from pig intestines, primarily sourced in China. Over 300,000 doses of
    heparin are administered daily in the US and the global heparin market is valued
    at $6.5 B. Over the past 12 years, swine diseases that reduced the pig population
    and limited the amount of heparin available led to economically motivated adulteration
    and rationing of heparin. Use of heparin derived from pig intestines also results
    in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in some patients, which can be reduced via
    bioengineered heparin. This project advances technology to produce heparin from
    genetically engineered cells to eliminate the need to source the drug from animals,
    securing its domestic production. \n\nThe proposed project pursues increasing
    the production of bioengineered heparin from cell lines. Previous work has resulted
    in cell lines that produce material with anticoagulant potency that equals pharmaceutical
    heparin. The current challenge is to increase yield to meet patient needs at a

    capacity by overexpressing the enzymes responsible for heparin production. Additionally,
    the cell culture medium and feeds used to grow the cells, which have been optimized
    for protein production, will be reformulated to optimize production of heparin
    in mammalian cells. The objective is to increase the productivity of cells about

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the United States, antibiotic resistance is estimated to cause over 2 million illnesses, 23,000 deaths, and cost $55 billion annually. Worldwide, it causes 700,000 deaths annually, and reduces global gross domestic product by approximately 1.5% through its impact on income, productivity, investment and healthcare costs. The animal sector accounts for up to 80% of antibiotic consumption in some countries. However, antibiotic feed additives are widely used in the cattle industry because they provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. As the industry already operates on narrow profit margins, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives may be financially catastrophic for many producers, and could lead to supply chain disruption. This project provides a solution to the beef cattle industry through development of a cost-effective alternative to antibiotic feed additives.

    The proposed project aims to develop a bacteriophage-based feed additive to inhibit the growth of the primary etiologic agent of bovine liver abscesses, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives in feedlot cattle. The first project objective is to convert a library of temperate bacteriophages to obligately lytic mutants to enhance their suitability for long-term inhibition of Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. The second objective is to optimize and scale up production of these bacteriophages and develop a product formulation that can be readily integrated into cattle rations. The final objective is to conduct feeding trials to optimize dosing requirements and obtain in vivo proof of efficacy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance new real-time tracking technologies that increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of container shipping across the world.  The container shipping industry underpins the modern supply chain and represents a $1.5 B market.  The proposed solution introduces 5G internet-of-things to tracking in worldwide shipping by demonstrating performance in the dirty, complex, and highly-cluttered environments of repair facilities and terminals crowded with container stacks.

    The intellectual merit of this project will be the continued exploration of backscattered mm-wave radio frequency identification (RFIDs)   for localization and communication.  In addition, although hardware and standards used for standard ultra-high frequency RFID-based localization systems have benefited from decades of improvements, methods appropriate for higher-frequency methods are virtually unexplored and feature radically different challenges. This effort will advance the tag and reader hardware and software, followed by optimization of the standard for the concurrent localization and communications with mm-wave backscatter tags. Finally, the project will conduct verification and validation of the mm-RFID system's mechanical and functional performance.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new method to distribute âlast mileâ fiber optic communication lines. Existing fiber installation methods like trenching require extensive approvals and are labor-intensive, disruptive, and cost-prohibitive, especially in underserved or remote areas. âLast mileâ fiber is the most expensive part of any installation with a market valued at over $50 billion. This solution enables a quick, low-cost deployment of optical fiber directly onto pavement without cutting into the surface, effectively turning a barrier into a pathway. This new method will enable ubiquitous fiber optic connectivity and will expand the reach of fiber optic networks through the âlast mileâ. By lowering fiber deployment costs and improving efficiency, this technology will accelerate the rollout of 5G, enable smart city growth, and deliver broadband access to rural areas. This solution extends the benefits of fast communications to previously inaccessible locations, connecting businesses, homes, hospitals, and schools,  providing access to information, knowledge, and opportunity for everyone.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to validate a new fiber installation method leveraging existing road networks. Using pavement as the base, low-profile fiber cables are bonded to the surface and protected against traffic and weather by layers of durable coatings. Fiber links can be installed quickly on-demand with an installation machine that requires no digging and minimal disruption. The research objectives of this project are to build and test three prototype machines in the field and to iterate on design.  The research includes using the machines to install fiber, test pavement transitions, and compare costs and speed against other installation techniques. The anticipated technical results will expand understanding of machine utility, improve the user interface, verify the suitability, and validate economics.

    Research (SBIR) project is to improve electronics cooling systems.  Data and telecommunications
    centers consume 200 TWhr/yr of energy and produce about 30 million tons of carbon
    dioxide, with nearly half of these numbers attributable to cooling. The electronics
    cooling market exceeds $10 billion/year with an 8% compound annual growth rate.
    The technologies developed here will significantly reduce those numbers, with
    significant environmental and financial impact, with improved hardware and software.
    \ This will benefit many sectors including next-generation 5G-wireless communications,
    high-performance computing, the Internet of Things, cryptocurrency, and national
    security. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop two complementary
    technologies for efficient thermal management of electronics. It will add compliancy
    to the structurally-rigid vapor chambers used for cooling, e.g., multicore processors
    where vapor chambers thermally couple a single heat sink to the different processor
    cores. This project will develop a mass production process of compliant vapor
    chambers accommodating novel forms of capillary wicks integrated with compliant
    diaphragms. Secondly, the project will develop a heat sink optimization platform
    for electronics hardware, coupling hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) with a multi-variable

    Phase II project is the development of a microalgae-based commercial hydrogen
    production process that will surpass current or developing technologies. A technology
    for low-cost, high purity, renewable, scalable hydrogen production can facilitate
    greater domestic energy independence. Many industries, such as the petro-chemical,
    chemical, and electronics sectors, would benefit from low-cost industrial hydrogen.
    Transportation and electric power generation industries would benefit from increased
    fuel efficiency. Environmental benefits include replacement of fossil fuels, switching
    hydrogen production from natural gas to sunlight and water, substantial emissions
    reduction. and reduction of airborne pollutants generated by coal- and natural
    gas-powered power plants. The goal of this project is to advance the use of engineered
    algae, in combination with recent advances in bioprocessing and hardware engineering,
    to manufacture clean, renewable hydrogen.                                                     \n\nThe

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase II project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology, based on naturally occurring small molecules proven to strongly activate plantâs natural defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed innovation is active at extremely low concentrations, can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic. Every year, approximately 500 million kg of more than 600 different chemical pesticide types are used; this costs an estimated $10 billion and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests and pathogens. By providing an alternative, effective method for managing diseases in crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals, synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance development. The proposed research will establish viability of a natural small molecule as a crop protectant and can improve the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides and significantly enhancing global food security.

    The proposed project seeks to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small, naturally occurring molecules that elicit specific immune responses in plants. The proposed project will demonstrate a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy under field conditions, adversely affecting neither seed germination/ growth nor natural microbe/insect populations. The project objectives are to 1) Perform multi-location field trials with wheat and soybean against three high-impact pathogens to confirm efficacy of seed treatments; 2) Conduct greenhouse studies to investigate potential synergies of seed and spray treatments, including in combination with other crop protection agents; 3) Determine effects of seed or spray treatments on nematode infestation in soybean; 4) Scale chemical synthesis of the active ingredient and optimize the seed-coating formulation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a reduction of counterfeit physical goods on a global scale, serving industries including pharmaceutical, defense, and others.  The proliferation of counterfeit goods is growing at an alarming rate, estimated at $1.2 trillion in 2017 and expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2020. Furthermore, approximately 300,000 children die each year from receiving fake medicines to treat aliments such as malaria, pneumonia, and other diseases. The proposed technology will mitigate economic loss incurred from the proliferation of counterfeit goods for organizations, governments, and individuals, and improve the health and safety associated with the risk of counterfeit or tampered goods. This innovation will be inexpensive to manufacture and can be widely applied.  Additionally, anyone in the supply chain, even an end-consumer with a common smart phone, can ensure that a product enabled with this innovation is authentic and untampered.

    The proposed project will continue development of a novel enhancement to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) that applies the concept of digital encryption to a physical seal or product packaging to detect if the barrier has been compromised. The project will advance the development of this technology by addressing two key development and engineering challenges. First, the project aims to miniaturize its current Printed-Circuit-Board (PCB) architecture into a single Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). While the PCB architecture is functional, its part count will be reduced by 95%. This will provide an orders-of-magnitude reduction in per-device cost and ensure suitable manufacturing yields. Second, the project will optimize the development of a tamper-sensing method.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve the use of water for the oil and gas (O&G) industry, especially during hydraulic fracturing, transforming the industry into a producer of fresh water and changing produced water from its current status as a waste product to a commodity. The proposed technology creates two reusable products: purified water and heavy brine. In addition to the high cost, disposal of produced water through deep injection wells has recently been linked to seismic activity and may impact groundwater quality, prompting policy solutions.  The O&G industry competes with other water uses, especially in US arid regions where significant O&G production occurs. Produced water, contaminated with salts, hydrocarbons, and metals, is generated each year through O&G production, costing $37B to manage in the U.S. Current demand for global fresh water resources for agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes is increasing, primarily due to reduction of water supplies in areas affected by drought, climate change, population growth, and expanding industries, as well as degradation of water quality due to contaminants from industry, flooding, or runoff.  The proposed project will provide a new treatment for water used in O&G production, creating a renewable source of fresh water from otherwise unusable wastewater or impacted water sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance the development of an innovative thermal distillation treatment system for produced water generated during O&G production. Current treatment technologies, like reverse osmosis, cannot handle the high-total dissolved solids (TDS) content of most produced water, and thus only a small portion may be reused currently. Disposal is generally through permitted deep injection wells, with water transportation typically serving as the largest disposal cost component. The proposed system accomplishes the entire thermal distillation process in one piece of equipment - a technological advance over state-of-practice thermal distillation units requiring separate energy sources, heat transfer, distillation, separation, and condensation units. It reduces manufacturing and maintenance costs, and it uses less energy in operation.  The system can be set up on-site at the well, eliminating the need to transport produced water off-site for disposal. The proposed treatment process yields two reusable products: (1) purified water, which may be sold for use at the well site, sold for agriculture/industrial uses, or discharged to surface waters; and (2) heavy brine, which may be sold as a drilling fluid.

    TheÂ broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the reliability of electric power generation.  Steady, uninterrupted service of power plants is often taken for granted in the economy, national security, and private use. The proposed product improves electric-power reliability by detecting a source of potential catastrophic failure of generator overload or startup, where a single event can cause damage of $10 million in repair costs and revenue losses from operational downtime. The innovation will help mitigate specific risks in the electric-power infrastructure.

    The proposed project aims to develop a portable magnetic-field monitoring device measuring Tesla-strength magnetic fields at a 100 ppm-level or better, with measurement times of 1 ms or less, and over a temperature range from 10 Â°C to 100 Â°C through spectroscopic techniques. The proposed atomic probe will naturally be resilient against electromagnetic interference.  The project addresses a need for sensors capable of monitoring the amplitude and direction of magnetic fields in large generators to avoid generator over-fluxing, which can lead to catastrophic failure and downtimes. The project will develop the probe head and control unit, and will further conduct verification and validation tests of the prototype.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable greater electric vehicle use; furthermore, the technologyâs potential to double battery life will reduce the environmental impact of disposed batteries. This project accelerates electric car adoption by enabling use of 100% of battery operating ranges and maximize usable energy capacity, increasing ongoing driving ranges by 50-100x. This project is a key enabler for expected growth in the global lithium-ion battery market (expected to grow to $68 B by 2022) and the annual hybrid and electric car market (forecast to exceed 10 million vehicles annually by 2025).

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to optimize the technology for battery fast charge and capacity retention targets. Battery performance advancements are most often limited by chemistry and materials improvements to electrodes, electrolytes, or cell structure limiting the trade space (i.e., requiring power vs. energy tradeoffs).  The proposed charging technology and associated software will selectively optimize cell design for various performance metrics by controlling electrode surface phenomena, such as lithium plating and dendrite formation, that otherwise cause permanent capacity loss during normal use and accelerate internal physical processes limiting charge rate. Technical tasks include: 1) Demonstration of performance improvements to commercial Li-Ion and fabricated Li-metal battery cells; 2) Adaptation of the process from small cells and modules to electric vehicle battery packs; 3) Development of refined sensing and feedback-based control algorithms using Predictive Learning (PL) and Machine Learning (ML) systems; 4) Verification and validation for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and System on a Chip (SoC) formats.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to improve satellite-based agricultural imaging to allow monitoring and managing of broad regions for enhanced sustainability and food security.  The proposed algorithms address noise in satellite data that is caused by the atmosphere.  The method can be used for many types of satellites, providing advantages in efforts to reduce weight and space to control launch cost.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address a major issue in modern remote sensing, atmospherically induced noise in the data. EOS systems look through the atmosphere that distorts spectral relationships of reflectance (ratio of EOS-measured reflected light to the sunlight that would be received were there no atmosphere). The variable atmosphere distorts the data variably so must be corrected to accurately interpret highly useful measures such as agricultural production/yield, photosynthesis, plant water use, plant disease/insect infestations, etc., rendering EOS data unreliable unless corrected. The technical tasks are to: (1) study European Space Agency Sentinel 2 EOS data, (2) migrate the method to NASA/USGS Landsat 8, (3) adapt the method for calibration of the several decades-long Landsat Multispectral Scanner record that cannot otherwise be corrected to surface reflectance, (4) develop a calibration tool for multiple commercial EOS, and (5) develop a fully integrated software system.

    artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing

    to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and their
    components. An EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates
    integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal
    manufacturing yield of ~65% and suffer from defectivity during fabrication of
    its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the
    debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and
    inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In
    high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability
    of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology.
    We propose a new EUV photomask which promises a higher robustness to defects,
    a higher manufacturing yield, better uniformity and more reusability of masks
    in operations and longer lifetime. The goals of the project are to evaluate new
    integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication
    process and characterize their EUV performance. More robust architectures reduce
    capital outlay requirements for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project further investigates music-based techniques that
    can result in effective and efficient learning and instruction. Music as a bedrock
    of culture can transcend entertainment and enhance learning. Music directly activates
    neural systems that support memory, attention, motivation, and emotion. Accordingly,
    music is a powerful medium that not only heightens learner engagement but also
    facilitates retention of information. While music has long been recognized for
    its mnemonic properties and is widely used as a memory aid in the context of early
    childhood learning (e.g., the ABC song), music-based educational products for
    the broader K-12 market are less pervasive. This project focuses on the optimization
    of musical structures to support effective and engaging mathematics instruction.
    The goal of this project is to offer music as a credible pedagogical tool. Specifically,
    this project offers music as a learning medium that can be used beyond rote memorization
    and instead teach mathematical skills, processes, and procedures in an engaging
    manner that makes math accessible to all learners. Mathematical fluency is a critical
    skill in a society that continues to become more technological; it also creates
    broader career opportunities for students and undergirds the U.S.'s national competitiveness.
    \n\n\nThe proposed research features two innovations: 1) optimization of learning-based
    musical forms based on distinct mathematical information types; and 2) creation
    of a non-linear, dynamic platform to deliver the content. Using computational
    musicology techniques as well as experimental studies, the first innovation involves
    creation of mathematically accurate music videos based on unique creative and
    structural parameters that are determined by the type of mathematical information
    being taught. The second innovation focuses on delivery of the music-based content
    and involves significant technical and creative investigation to produce a dynamic,
    non-linear mechanism for presenting the material in a manner that still feels
    continuous and compelling to the student. Together, both innovations underlie
    a synergistic learning solution designed for premium learner engagement and to
    support self-paced, adaptive learning. This project will result in high quality,
    digital math instruction that is accessible to all learners through use of effective,
    engaging, and relevant instructional methods. The desired outcomes are eliminating
    proficiency gaps in math education and achieving equity in students' educational
    success.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a significant advance in the production of hydrogen peroxide. It is anticipated that this project will yield an on-site generation method that substantially reduces the cost of peroxide production compared to the traditional centralized chemical process. By reducing cost, hydrogen peroxide can be used more widely as an oxidizer in bleaching, drinking water and wastewater treatment, and other processes, ultimately lowering chlorine pollution by replacing chlorine-based oxidizers. The pulp/paper and textiles industry will benefit from lower cost bleaching chemicals and reduced treatment costs. This method reduces environmental pollution and eliminates the need for transportation of explosive high-concentration hydrogen peroxide. The new design may have applications in other industrial systems.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate a scaled-up high efficiency alkaline hydrogen peroxide electrolyzer system. The end result will be a commercial demonstration-ready prototype. The electrode manufacturing process will be optimized for high-volume manufacturing on roll-to-roll coating lines. Electrolyzer prototypes will be built and tested at medium scale with a moderate cell count, then improved and scaled to full-size cells with a high cell count. Durability testing will be performed, including development of accelerated testing protocols, to facilitate screening of electrode materials and assess manufacturing variations implemented in roll-to-roll coating. These individual project goals will culminate in a commercial pilot-ready autonomous system for on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce injuries and costs due to overexertion and heat strain in firefighting through a real-time, biometric monitoring system and accompanying analysis tools. This system collects each firefighter's vital signs and sends the data to authorized commanders for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, commanders can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Almost 60% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year, and associated costs total over $7 billion annually.  The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve other first responders, such as military personnel, industrial workers, and others with occupational risk.

    The proposed project will improve the occupational safety of first responders through the research and development of the following components:  1) An improved biometric collection wearable; 2) software used by the biometric monitoring system; 3) a location-monitoring tool; 4) algorithms to estimate sleep quality, fatigue, and detect symptoms for certain diseases, and improve exertion and core-body temperature estimates. 5) network improvement solutions allowing first responders in remote areas to utilize biometric monitoring tools. All five objectives will consist of multiple pilot studies with ongoing research and development that will incorporate crucial feedback from end-users. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for partnering fire and emergency services.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address the lack of advanced maps of shallow water zones, or littoral zones, crucial to global ecology and economy.  An estimated 70% of the world's littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands with scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely.  Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence for amphibious landings and accurate assessment of the environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development. The resulting geospatial products will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite-derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different physical parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval to form complementary measurements. Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.  Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metaocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation; and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.  The shallow seafloor is a dynamic and poorly understood domain due to the complexity of the environment and navigational dangers of accessing unknown waters. The project's goal is to create a remotely produced, automated, self-validating satellite-based shallow seafloor mapping system by implementing artificial intelligence, advanced remote sensing and computer science algorithms and ongoing collection of earth observation imagery to globally produce 10-30 m resolution bathymetry elevation models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments costing hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by developing novel air pollution analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others.

    The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to use the proposed system for automation of yield mapping so that growers will be able to improve their growing and harvesting processes. Yield mapping is critical for fruit growers. An accurate estimate is enormously beneficial to sales operations, harvest time logistics, and crop management. Currently, yield mapping is performed manually in a difficult, laborious process prone to sampling and counting error. The proposed system would enable growers to sell better fruit at higher prices while using less resources. By bringing improved certainty to harvest quantity and timing, the system will also improve the efficiency of the entire fruit supply chain, making fresh fruit more readily available in stores at more consistent prices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the problem of automated yield mapping for fruit crops. Rather than relying on expensive sensing equipment such as laser-based lidar scanners, the company proposes to build a robust, yet inexpensive, fruit mapping system using commercial, off-the-shelf components. In order to achieve this goal, significant computer vision and systems challenges must be overcome. These include: (1) Adapting and developing accurate computer vision algorithms for fruit detection and segmentation, as well as geometric algorithms for sizing and tracking fruit and mapping the foliage; and (2) Building usable and reliable systems for scanning, upload, cloud processing, and results visualization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies ultimately in saving lives. This project proposes a Machine Learning-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) firearms detection system for law enforcement. Implementation of this technology would significantly reduce the cognitive burden of police officers in dangerous situations, allowing for more informed decisions. Additionally, there are benefits to the warfighter and security professionals to improve their capabilities in keeping the nation and public safe. Successful implementation and commercialization of a firearms detection system will grant capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data to find insights previously unknown, and to provide a data-driven approach towards real-time reactions around firearms and firearm usage.

    The proposed project aims to research and develop a Machine Learning-enabled, integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm activity, such as discharges and unholsters. The challenges are two-fold: 1) to develop and iterate based on pilot user feedback regarding the hardware and software portions of the system; and 2) to employ machine learning on a unique dataset for insights on firearms knowledge and handling. The proposed research and development plan calls for pilots with several law enforcement agencies, hardware and software iterations based on user feedback, and research into a real-life dataset collected by police officers.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop an external stent to improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with failed kidneys (i.e. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)). Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-70% failure rates within the first year. These failures are most often due to the vein's maladaptation to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in which cells within the vein wall migrate and grow inwards, causing obstruction of flow. Consequences of this are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and billions of dollars in direct costs to Medicare. The one-year mortality rate upon hemodialysis initiation is 22%, in large part due to vein failures at the access site that necessitate reliance on a centralized catheter that drastically increases risk of infection, thrombosis, and death - reducing survival to merely a coin flip. Despite some promising preclinical studies involving external stents, there is nothing on the US market to prevent access site failures, in part due to inappropriate biomaterial selection and device design.

    To address these issues, an external stent, or wrap around the vein-artery connection, is developed in this project. The wrap provides critical, custom-fit mechanical support and outward growth to the vein to help it adapt better to the high pressure, high flow arterial environment in a manner unique to this biomaterial. To realize the potential of this technology to improve vein patency and, in turn, the lives of dialysis patients, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling experiments need to be conducted to optimize device design. The computational models will be validated empirically under physiological pressures and flows through 4D Flow MRI experiments in which three-dimensional velocity profiles tracked over time enable cross-matching of actual experiments to computational models. This modeling is done with artery-vein connections from both ex vivo experiments utilizing human arteries and veins, and in vivo in sheep. Quality, FDA-compliant manufacturing of devices is enabled through collaboration with quality contract manufacturers, and biocompatibility is assessed. Lastly, the optimized design is tested in an FDA-compliant large animal model. The final outcomes of this project will be a better understanding of hemodynamics causal and preventative of vein failures, and development of an external stent that can that can ultimately impact - or even save - dialysis patients' lives.

    Research (SBIR) project includes advancement of the field of white biotechnology,
    which utilizes enzymes to create valuable industrial products. As biological molecules,
    enzymes are more difficult to manipulate than conventional chemicals and often
    need more extensive development before they can be adapted to industrial or pharmaceutical
    manufacturing. This SBIR project will demonstrate how enzymes' performance can
    be improved using stabilization with special synthetic materials known as polymers.
    Enzymes are characterized by precise, unique structure and function, which is
    in turn essential for their role in catalysis of complex chemical reactions. Synthetic
    polymers, on the other hand, despite being less precisely structured, can be rationally
    designed to withstand or respond to chemical, thermal or biological conditions.
    The synergistic fusion of enzymes and synthetic polymers results in an advanced
    enzyme with improved chemical properties, leading to new manufacturing processes
    for valuable products such as chemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals; these
    processes should require less energy, utilize fewer hazardous reagents, and generate
    less waste. \n\nThis SBIR  Phase II project proposes to develop a combinatorial
    synthesis device that can feed high-throughput screening of enzyme-polymer conjugates
    with desired properties (for instance, temperature, pH- or organic solvent stability).
    To date, only low-throughput synthesis and characterization methods have been
    applied to the preparation of enzyme-polymer conjugates, limiting development
    to only few types of polymer modification per protein and depending on stochastic
    guesswork to select the variants tested. Thus, in order to fully benefit from
    the diverse set of polymers currently available on the market, it is important
    to develop methods to scale the identification of optimally performing enzyme-polymer
    conjugates. This will be achieved through combination of high-throughput synthesis
    of enzyme-polymer conjugates and high-throughput screening of attained properties.
    The target application of the proposed research is focused on pharmaceutical biocatalysis.
    Application of a high-throughput method will not only result in faster research
    and development cycles, but also will accelerate our development of fundamental
    knowledge of identifying protein properties that can be achieved through polymer
    modification, thereby establishing this method for industrial applications.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster response. Future deaths and injuries of both victims and first responders during disaster rescues in unchartered, risky environments could be prevented by rapidly deploying sensor robots that use semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current emergency response procedures are time-consuming, requiring first responders to don protective suits and hand place sensors to obtain air quality readings. Current disaster robots cannot be rapidly deployed and can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Instead, tensegrity sensor robots dropped from aerial vehicles, such as drones or helicopters, can land in dangerous, often difficult-to-reach areas and immediately transmit surveillance and environmental data. With this information, first responder teams can better understand the situational hazards and plan how best to ameliorate the emergency saving lives, while reducing costs and property damage. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific and commercial monitoring and surveillance as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of tensegrity robots, their durability, and their propulsion, de-risking the technology for the commercial market. This work will focus on expanding the features and structures of two robotic platforms: (1) stationary robots that provide persistent monitoring in one location and (2) mobile robots that are capable of ground travel over rough terrain (rubble, rocks, slopes).  Finite element analysis/computational fluid dynamics simulations will be used to reduce the robots' weight and improve impact-resilience and portability. Software improvements will focus on enhancing speed capabilities and energy efficiency for rough terrain locomotion. Control engineers will integrate robust Model Predictive Control to improve path planning and enhance the robots' locomotion in a wide range of topologies and environments. Improved software algorithms and user interfaces will provide first responders with summarized data analytics for real-time assessments in the field as well as deliver cloud-server support. Integrated playback functionality and data-driven learning will improve post-situation evaluations. With technologies that provide live 360-degree video feeds and greater incident intelligence, this project will improve rescue outcomes in future disaster recovery operations.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a new source of human-grade protein that it can be produced at an estimated half the price of wholesale chicken and 2000 times higher protein yields per acre compared to soy with a fraction of the input requirements. The new protein addresses pain points in industry of potential allergens, amino acid composition, poor flavor and texture, and limited processability. If successfully commercialized, Emergy's potential impact is the ability to provide high quality protein to millions of people at 50% the price of animal protein, while saving the world greenhouse gas emissions, all with a significantly reduced land footprint.

    This SBIR Phase II proposes to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce high quality, economical, and sustainable protein for human consumption. To achieve this goal, Emergy grows filamentous fungi biomass as a human-grade protein source. The fungal biomass has one of the highest protein contents of any raw source available on the market (60% by weight) and is one of the only complete proteins. Emergy has developed fermentation parameters and used directed evolution to produce a fungal process/strain that provides several inherent advantages over traditional protein production methods. Advantages of production include, low resource requirements, high yields, safe and toxin free, and low unit costs. While this process has been demonstrated at the benchtop level, the technical hurdles include scaling production to industrial systems while maintaining the proper texture and quality. Emergy Labs plans on executing these goals by optimizing growth conditions in scaled bioreactors, defining industrial operating parameters, designing and proving a scalable manufacturing process, and demonstrating commercially relevant scale.

    Research (SBIR) project is to provide general commercial access to a new generation
    of affordable, high-efficiency aerosol samplers that will primarily be used in
    the Industrial Hygiene and Indoor Air Quality market.  The collection technology
    in these new instruments is unique in that it captures, concentrates and preserves
    airborne microbes in the same physical state they exist as they are suspended
    in the air we breathe- a tremendous breakthrough for forensic aerosol analysis.
    \ This work optimizes a novel collection method that chronologically resolves
    air samples into a portable compact platform, which ensures purity, minimizes
    handling and is safe for mail.  The sample output is delivered in small, sterile
    medical grade disposable plastics that are compatible with a broad range of users'
    analytical needs whether it be the military, health care, atmospheric researchers
    or indoor air quality sector.  This instrumentation is portable, and requires
    no filters or chemical additions; it rapidly condenses airborne microbes out of
    ambient air by manipulating humidity, offering a reliable way to assess microbiological
    air pollution-indoors or out.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to optimize
    the design of condensation growth-based bioaerosol samplers for commercial validation,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project arises from addressing one of the world's major challenges - the need for water. We address this problem through the development of a novel technology for economic desalting for inexpensive clean water generation and the treatment of high concentration saline waste. There is no "one size fits all" approach to water desalting. Many factors such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting a desalting technology. The carbon nanotube immobilized membrane distillation (CNIM-MD) being developed here offers many advantages such as the ability to utilize waste heat and solar energy and as well as the ability to handle high salt concentrations.  The CNIM-MD is being designed with the aim of treating high salinity water (above 750,000 ppm dissolved solids that are not normally handled by reverse osmosis (RO). The primary target market for CNIM-MD is concentrating brine for zero liquid discharge (ZLD) where brine is concentrated and the solids are eventually precipitated out, pure water is reused and no water is discharged as industrial effluents. Other potential markets for CNIM-MD are treating RO reject to increase pure water yield, and the treatment of produced water in oil and gas industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to scale up the CNIM fabrication process via roll-to-roll (R2R) coating, demonstrate CNIM-MD at pilot scale and initiate commercial sales. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the novel approach to design and synthesis of scalable membrane systems for water desalination, and the treatment of saline waste. The CAPEX and OPEX of CNIM-MD compared to thermal evaporators is compelling, and CNIM-MD can be a major component of a hybrid ZLD treatment train integrating membrane technology with thermal evaporator. In short, the development of CNIM-MD will be a major development in the area of membrane treatment of high concertation brine. The success in the synthesis of novel membrane architecture such as CNIM will impact in many areas beyond desalination, which include carbon capture, gas purification, emission control, dehumidification as well as capturing pure water from the atmosphere. They have potential to impact major industries such as power plants, petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, dehumidification, air purification, and food processing.

    Research (SBIR) project is to deploy a revolutionary water-flood technology to
    increase oil recovery.  The best current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery
    leaving significant resources in the ground.  The available methods to further
    increase recovery are expensive, have limited application and can cause environmental
    damage.  The proposed method is much less expensive and has minimal environmental
    impact.  Our technique does not use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk
    of contaminating ground and surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands
    of new wells, our approach revitalizes old fields and requires little modification
    to the existing infrastructure and operational procedures.  It would allow older
    fields to continue to operate, providing jobs and taxes while increasing and further
    diversifying our domestic oil reserves.  Full success of enhanced oil recovery,could
    produce up to 21.7 billion barrels of additional oil generating over $1 trillion
    for the US oil industry over the next twenty-five years, thereby increasing the
    energy security of the U.S. and creating more jobs while stabilizing domestic
    oil production at much lower costs than other technologies. \n\nThis SBIR Phase

    oil reservoirs through flotation experiments, computer modeling and field pilots.
    \ Once we have achieved good pH control during the flotation experiments, we will
    determine the impact on reservoir wettability, the effect of salinity on wettability
    and the equilibrium constants for the surface complexation computer model.  Finally,
    we will conduct concept validation projects in field to verify a minimum of 5%
    OOIP increase in oil production. Thus, we will provide producers with a field-verified
    process operators can implement to yield significant results for little cost.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is in the reduction of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by proactively responding to data from novel sensors.  In addition, the technology being developed in this project can also help measure airborne particle concentrations in other environments.  The successful completion of this proposal will result in improved public health from reduced hospital stay and commercially benefit both hospitals and patients by reducing hospitalization costs.  The development and deployment of sensors in a hospital, enabled by this project, will help our startup build a critical dataset to train analytical models for near real-time identification of hospital spaces with a pathogen problem.

    This STTR Phase 2 project proposes to develop a novel sensor for integrated measurement of air quality (AQ) and pathogen loads in the air and combine these measurements to create a an early warning system to identify contaminated areas in critical facilities like hospitals.  Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are $20 billion problem and are responsible for over 100,000 deaths in the US.  Our low-cost, robust, networkable, and easy-to-operate sensors will provide a data driven solution to the critical public health problem.  Combining novel techniques for real-time detection of airborne particles with state-of-the-art pathogen analysis, our sensor system will provide data to develop analytical models that will predict hospital spaces with pathogen problems before they cause expensive infections.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a breakthrough power source for small electronic devices that will move the reality of smart cities and smart rural areas closer to the vision. The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the 'Internet-of-Things' vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures.

    The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of "things" connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to hasten the deployment of autonomous transportation systems, which stand to reduce driving accidents and fatalities, enable new paradigms in urban design, reduce vehicle traffic, increase automobile efficiency, and improve air quality, benefiting the immediate health of drivers and non-drivers alike. A reduction in cost of transporting people and goods would increase the profitability of nearly all products and services, since nearly all activities require transportation in some form. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are simpler implementations of semi-autonomous controls systems but are already saving lives by providing intelligent cruise control, lane departure warnings, steering assistance, and preemptive emergency braking. As ADAS improves through advanced sensor and scanning hardware and becomes more widely deployed, more accidents will be avoided, and lives saved. There are currently no LiDAR imaging sensors that can sense greater than 200 meters and are automotive qualified due to limitations on the scanning systems. The proposed innovation would be the first to enhance a scientific and technical understanding of the reliability issues limiting wide-scale sensor deployment and result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in an automotive-grade laser scanning system that enables next generation LiDAR, a three- dimensional imaging sensor crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous delivery robots, drones, advanced driver safety systems in vehicles, and autonomous vehicles. Survey-grade LiDAR is a mature technology, but efforts to make it road worthy have failed due to the harsher shock and vibration requirements and deployed systems fail within two years and display image distortion under high-shock conditions. The proposed innovation will result in the first automotive qualified long-range LiDAR sensor by developing fluid stabilized opto-mechanical scanners that utilize buoyant forces to counteract external accelerations. The novel scanner technology will be simulated, fabricated, and tested against ISO specifications for automotive qualification to demonstrate both accurate real time scanner stability and long-term reliable operation. It is expected that the results will be scanners able to pass ISO testing in a form compatible with high-volume, low-cost production methods. Through collaboration with customers, this work will result in a new class of vision systems that will bring a new level of efficiency and safety in transportation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of unique portable energy harvesting and storage technology that can enable ubiquitous deployment of small wireless sensor modules throughout the nation's industrial, civil, agricultural, and institutional infrastructure. The portable power technology developed in this project will enable such devices to be deployed without the need for electrical cables or batteries. This will remove the single biggest technology barrier to growth of the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), namely the difficulty of installing and maintaining large numbers of wireless sensors in locations that need them. Wireless IoT systems, such as for safety monitoring, performance optimization, or predictive maintenance, can significantly increase productivity, efficiency, safety, and cost reduction of operations. This project's developments in electromechanical design, circuit design, and integrated manufacturing will advance the art of ambient energy harvesting technology. These perpetual energy products will help the United States take global leadership in IoT, providing significant economic benefit to the companies that use this technology for their IoT applications. Successful deployment of IoT directly translates into economic growth, increased worker safety, improved environment, and job creation.

    The proposed project will develop and manufacture small, inexpensive energy harvesters with built in energy storage for wireless IoT applications. These energy harvesting units will extract energy from ambient sources, such as vibrations, and will provide electrical power for small autonomous IoT devices. The units will feature on-board energy storage, providing power even if the ambient energy source is intermittent or if surge power is temporarily needed. The first units will be optimized for efficiently extracting electrical power from small amplitude vibrations at low frequencies, and can be manufactured at low cost. The same underlying technology can be used to extract energy from other sources, such as air/water flow, mechanical movement, or thermal gradients. The project leverages unique circuit designs and manufacturing processes that enable this unit to be (1) easily integrated into existing electronic systems, (2) efficient in extracting electrical power from low energy sources, and (3) manufacturable at an affordable, market-driven cost. This will result in the development of an extensive product line of small, portable inexhaustible energy sources for wireless IoT.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  Ambient energy harvesting technology for IoT wireless sensor
    applications'
- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a multi-sensory social skill
    program to improve the lives of children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum
    disorder (ASD). Currently, ASD is the fastest growing developmental disability
    in the US, with 1 in 59 children being affected. It is well established that children
    with ASD struggle with their social skills, which negatively affects the child's
    ability to make friends and integrate into the community and create their best
    life. Current interventions are expensive, time consuming, and parents, teachers,
    and therapists are seeking better solutions. This project will address these issues
    through the development of an affordable, time efficient application. The application
    will greatly improve social skills while also addressing sensory integration,
    anxiety, and self-esteem. As research continues and the product is refined, it
    will be broadened to all ages, targeting the ~5 million individuals with ASD in
    the US, and the ~74 million worldwide. Additionally, this project can be adapted
    to help non-ASD children who struggle with social skills or have developmental
    disabilities. Using the program in both homes and schools, creates a strong commercial
    impact, leading to a self-sustaining business. \n\n\nThe technical innovation
    of this project is an educational application developed for smart mobile devices,
    improving social skills for children diagnosed on the autism spectrum. This novel
    technology incorporates and combines proprietary source code, customizable features,
    integration of original music, video, facial recognition technology, and tracking
    tools to create a powerful modeling, learning, and practicing environment. The
    technology is the only social curriculum designed to allow students to learn and
    practice the social skill independently, or with other human interaction; including
    the ability to have multiple devices sync together, allowing practice to take
    place between participants in real time. The research goal is to develop and test
    an application, which teaches children with autism spectrum disorder to improve
    and generalize social skills to familiar and unfamiliar people. This will be accomplished
    through software development, which will include integration of video and music,
    testing for program glitches, compatibility with various devices, and technology
    that can be implemented in a one-to-one or group setting. A pilot study will include
    an intervention vs. control design to assess the effectiveness and user ability
    of the program with students in grades K-6 with varying degrees of autism, thus
    validating the need and effectiveness of the program.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project is a game-based learning virtual reality
    (VR) and desktop experience focused on fostering STEM (science, technology, engineering,
    and math) and robotics interest in young people. The project's intent is to address
    the growing skilled labor shortage in STEM fields and prepare learners for the
    cross-industrial rise of robotics. Through exposure to experiential STEM learning,
    the project will create a groundswell of student interest and aptitude that will
    help close STEM workforce gaps in the long term, as well as plant the seeds for
    a future cohort of robotics professionals. The project's hypothesis is that its
    game-based VR-enhanced learning platform can reliably instill design/engineering
    thinking skills into learners while exceeding the capabilities of existing educational
    tools in terms of scalability and adaptability to student needs. The project is
    additionally intended to drive K-12 VR hardware adoption by providing a compelling
    and teacher-customizable solution that will justify institutional hardware investments.
    When proven scalable, the project will act as a beachhead for other VR and game-based
    learning entrants to bring their own innovative learning content into the K-12
    ecosystem, simultaneously promoting the progress of science in alignment with
    the NSF's mission, as well as providing a broad economic lift to the American
    economy by unlocking a new market sector. \n\nAs a VR-first experience, this project
    will provide students with a first-of-its-kind immersive robotics sandbox that
    allows for hands-on experimentation. Players will be able to form hypotheses,
    build robots, test, and iterate, mirroring the processes of project-based robotics
    and maker programs. Beyond robot construction, the project will offer challenge
    courses that test players' ability to build to specification. Each course will
    require a different physics-based solution for which a capable robot must be constructed.
    For example, a course might challenge players to navigate a set of stationary
    obstacles and then place a cube on a pressure plate, requiring a robot with maneuverability
    and the ability to pick up, transport, and place objects. This task serves as
    a model of the underlying dynamics of engineering design: identifying a problem,
    thinking critically, and developing a solution engineered specifically to that
    problem. To establish this project in the larger context of teaching media, it
    will be developed as a desktop-only intervention, a VR-only intervention, a desktop/VR
    hybrid intervention, and a paper-based control intervention. These variants will
    be tested with middle school and high school end users to verify the efficacy
    of game-based VR as a pedagogy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    career-building experiences online and in their communities. The intended outcome
    is a web-based career platform that fosters career self-efficacy and increases
    knowledge of occupations and career pathways. The proposed platform consists of
    (1) an engaging app for youth ages 14 to 25 based on popular game mechanics; (2)
    a Web-based advocate (educator) dashboard that reports on individual and aggregate
    user career exploration and skill-building activity, and supports public and private
    organizations? need for visibility into youth interests and skills as a way to
    prioritize funding; and (3) an implementation toolkit, featuring 30+ lesson plans
    as well as professional development videos for integrating the platform in a wide
    range of formal and informal academic and advisory settings. This project's broader
    impact is to help youth foster career readiness and, thus, increase their likelihood
    of staying in school, finding good employment, and gaining greater social mobility.
    This increased career readiness ensures a pool of qualified applicants for employers
    in industries across the U.S. \n\n\nThis project combines empirically-tested career
    development methodologies, proven game-based learning principles, and open big
    data about careers to provide personalized, accurate career guidance. The app
    engages youth in building personal profiles using visualized psychological assessments
    (based on validated inventories). A proprietary system then recommends Hats (careers)
    to explore and Ladders (activities) to complete that provide real-world learning
    supported by a range of motivators (level design, self-reflections, achievement
    badges, social sharing, and mentor communication). Data generated during Ladder
    activity and self-reflections strengthens the user's profile and, thus, the accuracy
    of the recommendation engine. The project employs design-based methods as the
    overarching research approach. A final evaluation of the completed program will
    be conducted in both high school and after-school settings. Career readiness,
    persistence, and perceptions of ability and of the H&L program will be assessed
    using quantitative methodologies. The anticipated result is a highly effective
    career development program that engages 21st-century learners with foundational
    career-building experiences. Students will be able to identify career aspirations,
    based on interests and occupational data, and gain greater confidence in their
    ability to navigate and adapt to changing career pathways.\n\nThis award reflects

    an entirely new way of doing mathematics. It leverages off the recipients' previous
    projects that resulted in an interactive equation manipulation system and a mathematics
    communication system. This project expands the technology into a comprehensive
    platform for learning, doing, and communicating mathematics. The innovation directly
    addresses deficiencies in STEM education and educational technology products by
    providing a tool whereby users can learn math by exploration and rapidly develop
    an intuitive understanding of how equations work through discovery. As such, it
    opens the creative doors to the world of mathematics to a wide range of students
    who might otherwise slip through the cracks of traditional mathematics education
    simply because they think differently. The net impact on society is a lower barrier
    to entry to STEM fields and an increase in math literacy - thus helping to maintain
    our standing as global leaders in innovation. \n\nThis project researches and
    develops a comprehensive modern mathematics system for students and professionals
    to effortlessly explore and solve complex equations through a simple and artful
    interface, elegant design, and powerful math engine. It expands on the recipient's
    already unique product offerings to create a transformative mathematics platform.
    The platform is an innovative new way of doing math that allows users to enter
    any equation on almost any device, and solve it using simple drag-and-drop gestures.
    Its freeform approach to computer algebra retains the exploratory aspects of pen-and-paper
    calculations, while benefiting from the computational prowess of the underlying
    math engine. With a unique user interface and networked multiplayer support, it
    is also a powerful real-time communication and collaboration tool. This project
    drastically enlarges the breadth of the technology by focusing on critical tasks
    in three core areas of development: expanding its core mathematics features, maturing
    its peer-to-peer math communication system, and structuring its overall system
    architecture. The project prepares the platform for a precise product-market fit
    to target school districts for direct licensing, and online education companies

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a comprehensive physiological monitoring platform that provides individuals working in hazardous occupations, such as firefighters, with longitudinal and real-time physiological monitoring that includes predictive diagnostics. Because existing physiological monitoring products are cost-prohibitive for most fire and emergency service agencies, and 50% of firefighter deaths are due to sudden cardiac events, this technology offers fire-service agencies an affordable mechanism for addressing this critical problem. Multiple studies have shown that early detection of an irregular heart-rate event (arrhythmias) offers a significant advantage in preventing and treating further CVD. The proposed technological innovation would consist of a wearable physiological monitoring device, which will use a range of networking mechanisms to communicate with a user-friendly analytical platform. Further, the integration of a self-alert system into a wearable patch would support a standalone operation even if there were to be a communication lag between a firefighter and command center. Early detection of arrhythmias and promoting corrective actions could reduce each individual cardiovascular disability claim by about $325,000.

    The proposed project aims to reduce the economic and social costs associated with firefighter injuries and fatalities due to underlying cardiovascular-disease and the extreme physiological strain resulting from the hazardous occupational environments in which fire services personnel work. The affordability of the proposed technology would not only improve occupational safety in the industry, but also enable scientists to further scientific knowledge about the interrelationships between oxygen saturation, ECG values, and extreme heat and physiological stress by using this technology to conduct experimental and field-based research. The longitudinal analysis possible with this platform would also give scientists the tools necessary to research the relationships between physiological stress and human performance factors, to gain a deeper understanding about critical factors in mechanisms such as decision making, risk perception, and communication. These factors are frequently cited in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after incident investigations of firefighter fatalities, along with playing important roles in the operating procedure standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive sensing elements which provides precise temperature readings to positively impact the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure). Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care. Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout.

    The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature that would be integrated into a diabetic-friendly insole. Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing. A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept shoe insert is designed to reside daily in a patient's shoes to continuously record the patient's foot health. In addition, the software system, including a mobile app for users as well as a doctor dashboard, is developed as a communication channel between the patient, the healthcare provider and the caregiver.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project aims to create and test a game-based intelligent
    tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social
    emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has shown that
    early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for
    success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved
    social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including
    those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately
    impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed
    by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional
    learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible,
    and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students
    as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly
    translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention
    that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible
    with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based
    and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded
    instruction. \n\n\nThis project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent
    Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social
    emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science
    and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models
    where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented.
    However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like
    social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and
    what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several
    significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but
    may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations
    are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively
    enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more
    student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate,
    leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance
    the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition
    to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this
    SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of screen-printed receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that are flexible, lightweight, low-cost and adapted to the entire population from infants to adults. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long examination times and a high rate of failure, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $4 billion in the United States alone. Printed receive coils are extremely flexible, lightweight, and conform well to the human body. With this technology, coils can be designed and manufactured inexpensively to fit all patient sizes, thus improving image quality and enabling robust acceleration of the method. These benefits can contribute to increase the success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time, enhance the clinical workflow, and reduce equipment costs. Printed coils will improve the quality of care offered by MRI suites and increase the availability and use of MRI to a wider patient population. Overall, this project will develop a clinical-ready system capable of delivering the full economic and clinical benefits of printed coils, which will contribute to a reduction of the healthcare costs associated with MRI.

    This project aims to fully realize a clinical-ready system consisting of a collection of printed, flexible lightweight MRI coil arrays, and connecting to a single universal cable to interface with the MRI scanner. A first part of the project will focus on the design of the cable and the associated connection scheme allowing interchange of multiple printed coil arrays of different sizes. Different strategies will be examined with the intent of maintaining high performance and safety while maximizing the advantages brought by printing. A second project goal will focus on the development of a collection of printed coil arrays for patient sizes ranging from newborn to adult, that are compatible with the universal cable and for both 3T and 1.5T scanners. The arrays will be designed for body imaging and will consist of 32-channel devices divided into 16-channel posterior and anterior portions. Their performance will be compared to a commercial 32-channel product. The final system will meet all the safety requirements for medical use and will be ready to be manufactured at scale.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye.  Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo.  Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo.

    During this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly.  In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties.  Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties.  This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed.  Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass.  A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale range. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering in digital prototyping, and therefore reduce the waste from using physical material samples during design, engineering, and manufacturing. This technology will help reduce product development time and cost, and lead to a greater sustainability.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance at greatly reduced cost.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is multilayered. First, there is the potential for creation
    of a carbon nanotubes manufacturing industry in the United States that will create
    hundreds of high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs advance U.S. leadership and
    knowledge in industrial electrochemistry. Secondly, Saratoga Energy's technology
    has the potential to benefit the United States economy by increasing the cost-competitiveness
    and performance of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way to the broader adoption
    of electric vehicles and grid/renewable energy storage. In turn, this will help
    reduce the strategic importance of oil, the cost of securing global oil supplies,
    as well as greenhouse gas emission. While lithium-ion batteries are the focus
    of this body of work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also used in a variety of other
    applications - advanced composite materials, nanotechnology, catalyst supports,
    water filtration, and other areas of commercial impact. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to 1) electrochemically characterize carbon nanotubes as a cathode
    conductive additive for high-performance lithium-ion battery applications and
    2) construct a small pilot-scale carbon nanotube manufacturing unit capable of
    producing 1 kg of product per day for retail distribution. Saratoga Energy Research
    Partners, LLC (Saratoga Energy), has developed a high-selectivity electrochemical
    process to convert carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes. In the work conducted
    thus far, Saratoga Energy has established that its carbon nanotubes can be manufactured
    at a cost ~50X cheaper than the market price for state-of-the-art battery-grade
    carbon nanotubes.  Battery manufacturers use carbon nanotubes to enable the reduction
    of conductive additive content in the cathode, thus improving specific and volumetric
    energy density. Carbon nanotubes also act as a reinforcing agent in the electrodes
    improving their mechanical properties. This is important for the battery assembly
    process but also for battery life performance, as the carbon nanotube network
    maintains a high level of cohesion of the electrodes upon repeated charge-discharge
    cycles. However, today, the high price of commercial carbon nanotubes limits their
    use, which will be addressed by our lower cost CNTs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase overall crop health and production with the proposed smartphone compatible crop health sensor. More specifically, crop disease remains a significant threat to global food security, and with the ability to perform pre-visual screening, the proposed platform enables cost efficient, quantitative detection of crop disease, empowering farmers to take action to reduce disease impact. Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    Research (SBIR) project is to allow for the recycling of valuable materials from
    complex wastes that today cannot be recovered. The commercial impact from this
    innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials,
    such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture
    of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that
    use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost,
    efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive
    for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills,
    oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded,
    successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex,
    multi-component materials.    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such
    as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does
    not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these
    wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical
    techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling
    of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take
    place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation
    in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the
    process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials
    such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers
    such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop
    the proposers' current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an
    emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various
    chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion
    of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale.\n\nThis award reflects

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a personalized learning environment for guiding students in effective use of educational sketching in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM). There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.


    This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

    This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


    This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

    This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


    The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving
    the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects
    5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two
    thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease
    in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population
    with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest,
    currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations
    and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of
    4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed
    for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically
    for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and
    operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and
    families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia.
    \n\n\nThe proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by
    detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed
    by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve
    two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the
    ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical
    tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing
    methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection;
    (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system
    proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up
    to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

    The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,Â Â new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

    This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


    This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

    to create a positive impact on current and future wireless systems. Multifunctional
    reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology targeted in this project enables a single
    antenna element to dynamically change its frequency band, radiation pattern and
    polarization properties, which directly impact the radio-frequency (RF) coverage,
    capacity, and quality of service achieved by any wireless network. Machine-to-machine
    communications, Internet of Things applications, satellite communications, radar-based

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for
    use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications.
    5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
    technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral
    efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity.
    Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands,
    where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb
    antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and
    the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them
    commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array
    gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage,
    increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF
    nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment
    by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta
    prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm
    that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.\n\nThis

    Transfer (STTR) will be to develop a platform to accelerate the engineering of
    biological products, including enzymes and pathways, for production of chemicals,

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.

    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
    connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
    product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology.  Lower
    back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic
    surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back pain
    relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event
    of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project
    seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit,
    by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode grid technology.  By positioning
    a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, the team is expected
    to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision therapy.   To accomplish
    these goals, the project includes three critical tasks including:  (1) develop
    a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics, package, and lead array,
    (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and (3) prepare prototypes for
    subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal of the project is to accelerate
    the medical-grade hardware development effort to enable future therapies to treat
    low-back pain.  Eventual validation after this project is completed will be performed
    in humans by selectively applying stimulation and recording if the patient feels
    therapy in the low-back area."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


    The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This SBIR Phase II project should increase the adoption of pedagogically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective use of business concepts taught and relevant to managing organizations. Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market.

    This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project was initiated as a direct result of extensive
    research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation,
    we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math
    cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International
    tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards
    (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual
    reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act
    math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive
    Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive
    failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction
    is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional
    output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in
    exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education
    for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential
    to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial
    acceptance in schools throughout the US. \n\nThis project is designed to provide
    simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade,
    using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms
    throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds
    math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students
    can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions,
    both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have
    context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical
    abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive
    real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying
    the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive
    Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to
    direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error
    repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show
    the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive
    Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting
    higher math applications and scientific discovery."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,
    ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes.
    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about
    vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique.
    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology
    will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  An Intelligent Mental Health Therapy System'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the reduction in severe patient morbidity and elimination of hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures by the U.S. healthcare system each year on revision surgeries and unnecessary procedures associated with late detection of post-surgical blood clots. Surgeons have the ability to prevent these catastrophic events, but only if the onset of the clot can be detected in a timely manner. Currently, of the patients who form clots after the targeted surgeries, half will suffer from a surgical failure due to the shortcomings of current modalities. This technology gives clinicians the ability to non-invasively track changes in blood flow within critical vessels to enable intervention prior to any compromise in health and prevent a majority of these catastrophic incidents. Beyond significant decreases in patient suffering and morbidity, such interventions will have an enormous positive economic impact on the health care system. This technology can also substantially improve clinical understanding of the clotting process and possibly enable non-invasive therapeutic treatments for these patients who otherwise would receive surgery.

    The proposed project offers significant intellectual and scientific merit associated with new methods of ultrasound flow analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a system that is able to collect a 3D volume of ultrasound data and automatically extract the blood flow data in the region of interest by detecting an implantable component. This novel approach to measuring vascular flow will be the first to enable detection of localized post-operative clot formation rather than detecting clot-related issues via delayed and indirect methods that leave patients at risk for surgical failures. This technique can allow for intervention earlier than all other available methods, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. Furthermore, this method enables automatic detection of critical changes in blood flow, eliminating the risk of human error. Lastly, dissemination of the technology developed in this proposal represents an important milestone towards the creation of simpler, more automated ultrasound systems that can place this non-invasive, non-ionizing modality in the hands of non-expert clinicians for use in a broader spectrum of medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide wireless technology for economic high-speed internet connectivity in under-served rural regions, addressing the needs of 40 million Americans and over 50% of the global population. The technological developments in this project will pave the way for adoption of Massive, or Many-Antenna MIMO technologies in next-generation wireless systems by addressing scalability bottlenecks with innovative hardware and protocol design. The result of this project will be a revolutionary new wireless system for internet service providers addressing an $80 billion fixed wireless systems market and connecting under-served global communities to high-speed internet commerce, communications, education, and entertainment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a production-ready Television White Space (TVWS) Massive MU-MIMO wireless system for IP data traffic, then use it to characterize for the first time diverse, large-scale multi-user TVWS channels. This project will demonstrate the first economically-viable Massive MIMO system, as well as the first point-to-multipoint wireless system capable of non-line-of-sight ranges over 10s of miles with over 2 Gbps of aggregate capacity. The system will be used to measure and characterize TVWS channels at scale in various rural environments, with large beamforming arrays serving tens of clients tens of miles away. In particular, these measurements will explore the effect of range, environment, user separation, and polarization on real-world achievable capacity. The results will be used to guide the design, optimization, and deployment of rural TVWS broadband networks across the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the introduction
    of high-speed\nwireless modems usable subsea and significant cost reduction of
    deep-water operations ?\nindustry experts estimate savings of nearly 20% of deep-water
    operations through the\navailability of subsea WiFi. Today, there is no broadband
    wireless communication available\nunderwater. In the deep ocean, remotely operated
    vehicles (ROVs) require a tether for\ncommunication and a support ship for tether
    management; sensors and systems must either be\nphysically connected, or retrieved
    from the deep sea to exchange data. An ROV support ship\ncosts about $120k/day
    leading to over $7B spent on ROV support ships in 2013. The proposed\nmegabit-per-second
    technology would allow ROV manufacturers and operators to cut the\ntether on many
    of their vehicles. Wireless ROVs can move unencumbered throughout coverage\narea,
    piloted from anywhere (e.g. from Houston), without expensive surface vessels.
    The\nproposed wireless modem technology connects ROVs and machinery to wired infrastructure,\nenabling
    safe operation of heavy subsea machinery without the possibility of cables or
    tethers\ngetting tangled, causing damage or worse. This project will create 10
    new jobs in the next three\nyears, with many more to be added as the production
    scales.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes
    to develop a faster\nand more reliable wireless communication system for the sub-sea
    industry. Current state of the\nart communication links for the deep ocean are
    either tethered, requiring long, bulky, and\nexpensive cables to connect machinery
    and systems, or have extremely low data rates, enabling only \nthe most rudimentary
    of tasks. The proposed underwater wireless communication\nsystem will provide
    WiFi-like data rates in the Mbps (megabits/sec) range ? 100 to 1,000 times\nfaster
    than existing underwater wireless communication technologies - and enable video\nstreaming
    and real-time control of subsea infrastructure, machinery, and mobile underwater\nvehicles.
    Since radio signals do not propagate far underwater, the proposed technology uses\nsound
    waves, as whales and dolphins do, for communication. The speed of sound is 200,000\ntimes
    slower than the speed of radio propagation, and mobile acoustic transmitters and\nreceivers
    hence suffer from severe Doppler distortion. The proposed technology dynamically\nmeasures,
    tracks, and compensates for this distortion, to enable wireless communication
    at\ndata rates never before possible underwater."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to help address the issue of non-bio degradable plastics polluting the planet through the development of biodegradable urethane monomers, formulations yielding industry standard performance metrics for their application.  There are 2,600 pounds of plastic trash accumulated for each living person today, with at least 18 billion pounds of plastic entering our oceans every year.  Sustainable products have yet to be commercialized at scale due to high cost and low quality.  We will change the urethane industry through the commercialization of high-performance biodegradable materials and development of high value consumer products.

    This project proposes to address the lack of biologically based materials in consumer products by utilizing algae polyols, and their formulation chemistries, to develop and optimize appropriate bio-based formulations, specifically polyurethane foams, for consumer use as footwear.  The company will demonstrate biodegradability of the product.  The company will also develop the supply chain and associated processes for their algae raw materials to produce algae polyols at scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make the 'green' solar industry truly green. As the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will appear in large quantities by early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today's prices for solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15/module by our technology, as compared to $3.50/module by today's technology. The primary work of this project will be developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.
